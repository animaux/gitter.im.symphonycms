@nitriques There’s a bug on the Symphony Documentation… all the links to
github contain an extra `/symphony/` within the url is that filed in the
standard repo or there’s another place for the website/docs?

____

FYI I added a new option - which allows you to set an ‘author’ field override

____

in case you want an author field to determine who has access to the entry

____

A Taglist would also work :)

np :) I’m currently using it with a Tag Field as client sets authors using a
tag field. Some Authors have symphony access others dont. This would enable
them to edit own entries, and transfer ‘authorship’ to others. say if the
editor added it the writer can edit. Still untested by the client but should
be far more robust than the previous version as entry filtering is done via
SQL not via the UI. So no data which is unwanted should load

yep same goes for editing/creating/deleting entries. It all checks permissions
and throws a symphony error if permissions are denied. Say if someone figures
out the ‘save’ button etc. I didn’t do any checks on ‘hidden’ fields though…

yeah right now that’s what I have

____

a tag list, but you could use the Author Field

____

when it’s the Author Field I match the ‘author_id’ otherwise it matches the
Full Name to the value

standard - I mean you use the standard extension but I obviously custom-coded
within the Author Roles extension to handle the two most common use-cases

____

If you use an Association and/or something else let me know and I can check
and bake it in if necessary

Ok cool. I use Association and Entry Relationship Field quite a bit so maybe
I'll try testing those in a bit.

I’m pretty sure they won’t work out of the box - but if I see your
configuration I can get them to work

Usually a main textarea for content and a ERF field is linked for additional
media type secitons.. videos, image galleries, more textareas.. that sort of
thing.

Ah what I meant is that the check looks for say an ‘Author’ field within all
the relevant sections.

so if you want ‘blogs’ filtered by Author it would look within the blog
section for an Author Field, should you define one

____

otherwise it default to use the ‘entry’ owner

That is actually very nice and finely tuned permissions to be honest. Only
those assigned or creating that entry have access if you build it that way I
guess.

then there will be part 2 which I think will be a separate extension for
group-permissions

hope you’re looking forward as your first symphony site will probably be a bit
of challenge but once you get the first one or two out of the way it should be
far simpler.
