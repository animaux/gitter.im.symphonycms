@josealbertorodriguesjunior In the preferences page, you can change how
Symphony tries to send email. Sendmail() is the default, which from memory
requires a bit of rejigging on localhost to get it sending for a local test
environment. Or you can use smtp() where you put in the credentials for
whichever service you use (like Gmail). This is the easiest option for sending
from a local environment.

____

Also look into the Email Template Manager extension for sending nicely laid
out HTML, or plain text, emails.

____

Who has used the Snipcart ecommerce system with Symphony before? Does it play
nicely with quantity breaks, and customer logins etc? e.g customers log in
through the site for specific products, can we then use that login for the
cart? Or does Snipcart need it 's own customer base?
