When I try to make a template for ERF like in @nitriques screencast my backend
entry says

____

    
    
     XSLTProcessor::importStylesheet(): compilation error: file file:///D:/wamp/www/munki-49/ line 3 element import

My associated section is called  "Photos", my template file is called
photos.xsl and I'm trying to put something in here

     <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

The URL it says is the root of my site folder it doesn't say what the file is,
I can't find one with import on line 3. I presume it's something from Sym
core?

Is this something to do with the errors other people were having on localhost
XSL import? I'm on Winderz
