When I try to make a template for ERF like in @nitriques screencast my backend
entry says

__ __

    
    
    XSLTProcessor::importStylesheet(): compilation error: file file:///D:/wamp/www/munki-49/ line 3 element import

__ __

My associated section is called "Photos", my template file is called
photos.xsl and I'm trying to put something in here

__ __

    
    
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
     <xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
         xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">
    
     <xsl:template match="entry">
    
     </xsl:template>
    
     </xsl:stylesheet>

__ __

but I just get the error all the time. Anyone know what's up?

The URL it says is the root of my site folder it doesn't say what the file is,
I can't find one with import on line 3. I presume it's something from Sym
core?

Is this something to do with the errors other people were having on localhost
XSL import? I'm on Winderz
