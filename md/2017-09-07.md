@SagaraZD I don't think so.. you need to add your datasource to another json
page for example and then retrieve the data

@SagaraZD Here's a utility which helps you output to JSON
<http://www.getsymphony.com/download/xslt-utilities/view/26420/> So you would
need to create a separate page and make its Type JSON.

@SagaraZD if you’re fine with pulling out xml. I used to add a url param eg
ajax to some pages

____

when my HTML recognises the param I output the data in XML

____

you can use it as a trick within the apply-templates

____

I don’t think I’ve used that method on any of the projects which you might
have access to

Hi everyone, I need to upgrade symphony from 2.2.5 to the latest version.
Before that I need to install "Limit section entries" and "Association field"
Plugins. Since they're not supported for the Symphony 2.2.5, what're my
options ? If I extract these plugins into the extensions folder, site is not
working. Please can anyone help me?

probably you would need to update to 2.3.x first

____

because that was a breaking change where assocaition field came in.

____

re Association Field, what fields do you have right now?

Sorry, I don't have any idea about the association fields in the site as this
is done by someone else.

aha! I don’t remember 100% but in theory I think you might be able to update
symphony first, then migrate the extension later.

____

I suggest you’d take a backup first before trying to upgrade

Is that OK If I do Symphony first and then the extensions ? Is there any
possibility I lose any data ?

there shouldn’t be any data loss. the upgrade doesn’t modify and/or drop
extensions. But as I suggested take a database backup before you try this just
in case

@mprofitl sorry to be so late to the party. While I agree with you, I do not
have the time do to everything. You are right when you say taht the content
should be merge at one place: we will do this. I'll import lots of stuff
directly into the codebase. But again, this takes a lot of time which I do not
have: I'd rather code! If you would like to help, create a list of links you
would want to keep! Finally, did you managed to fix your timeout issue ?

____

BTW I have made great progress in the past week for 3.0.0

@nitriques Unfortunately I have no clue how to fix the timeout issue. Do you
have a hint where to look for a more detailed log?  
When you write that wou will import stuff directly into the database: which
stuff into which database? I'll get back to you with a list and suggestions.
