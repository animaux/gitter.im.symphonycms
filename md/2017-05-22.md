@michael-e ~~in`ENM` is it not possible to select a recipient-group on entry-
basis?~~

____

~~It seems it has to set for the whole section.~~

____

Ah ok. Nevermind. Found out how to :)

@michael-e BUT!

____

Whenever I create a new a recipient group, I also have to add it in the
newsletter-section-settings. It would be handy if all groups would be
selectable for the user. I will try and look into your code …

I’ve also move the `Recipient Groups` in a user-editable nav-group and
foolproofed some things. Users are always very creative in fucking things up
in the backend `:D`

____

… have to be careful not to update `ENM`.

Hmn, as soon as I filter for `{$enm-newsletter-id}` I get `22. May 2017 14:26
> UNKNOWN: Email Template Manager: No valid recipients are selected, can not
send emails.`. Using static recipient list.

____

Ah, ok, Fotgot to include the ENM-field in the DS
