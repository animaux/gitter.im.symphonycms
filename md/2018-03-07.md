Hmn, what could be wrong if JIT 1.47 is outputting all images in original size
no matter if a recipe or numeric params are used? I’m guessing `.htaccess`?
It’s on a site recently updated to 2.7.x and PHP 7.

____

PHP 7.1 to be precise

Image rules in `. htaccess` seem to be right.

____

No errors.

____

JIT is simply passing through everything.

Looks normal:

         'image' => array(
            'cache' => '1',
            'quality' => '90',
            'disable_regular_rules' => 'no',
            'disable_upscaling' => 'no',
            'disable_proxy_transform' => 'no',
            'memory_exhaustion_factor' => null,
            'allow_origin' => null,
        ),

@nitriques seems to be working but I’d love to test/run it a bit more

'memory_exhaustion_factor' is 2.0 @animaux here you sure that you are running
the right files ?

____

@jonmifsud I am pretty confident about that change, I've already tested it
myself ;)

great; I didn’t have time to test much; meetings most of the day though the
few entries I tried it seems to run smooth. I’ll get that update sorted

@nitriques I might have had 2.0 running accidentally and switched back to 1.x.
Should I remove that line?

Still no idea. Is there any debug-stuff in JIT I could turn on?

OK. I replaced the extension with a fresh download. I guess something broke
when going back from 2.x to 1.x. All ok now. Thanks! :·)
