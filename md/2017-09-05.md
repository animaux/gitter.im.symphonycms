@nitriques Would you have a hint how I can debug an endless loop when saving a
section (not an entry of that section, entries can still be saved)? @animaux
thought you might have. Apache and Symphony error log say [error] [client
XXX.XXX.X.XX] PHP Fatal error: Maximum execution time of 1200 seconds exceeded
in /home/username/[scheitlin-
syfrig.ch/htdocs/symphony/lib/toolkit/class.gateway.php](http://scheitlin-
syfrig.ch/htdocs/symphony/lib/toolkit/class.gateway.php) on line 386, referer:
<https://scheitlin-syfrig.ch/symphony/blueprints/sections/edit/1/>. Thanks for
your ideas!

@mprofitl @nitriques not sure if this is a loop â€¦ I was just guessing.
