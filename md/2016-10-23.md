You can do it using variables and format-number to round 2 decimals

__ __

&lt;xsl:variable name="total" select="format-number($price * $quantity,
'#.##')" /&gt;

__ __

then later in the template if you want always 2 decimals &lt;xsl:value-of
select="format-number($total, '#.00')"/&gt;

and if you need to add a tax : &lt;xsl:value-of select="format-number($total +
$tax, '#.00')"/&gt; for exemple

                <xsl:call-template name="options">
                    <xsl:with-param name="leftOptions" select="$leftOptions[position() &gt; 1]" />
                    <xsl:with-param name="unitPrice" select="$unitPrice" />
                    <xsl:with-param name="subtotal" select="$subtotal + ($unitPrice * $path/multiplier)" />
                </xsl:call-template>
            </xsl:when>
    
            <!-- Afisam total -->
            <xsl:otherwise>
                <xsl:value-of select="$subtotal" />
            </xsl:otherwise>
        </xsl:choose>
    </xsl:template>

the orrange titles are the products (first loop) each with **options** (second
loop) and **volume** (3rd loop)

__ __

about svg animation i just did (almost finished) this: <http://www.dixxit.fr
/le-contenu-remanent/> it s only 1 svg animated by js/css

Using vuejs I had the plaisure to work with symphony in the back to generate a
json api to feed a quizz webapp: <http://quizzy.notespot.net/2OM9O/>

__ __

perhaps on stackoverflow... I don't remember where, anyway, I stop spamming
the Symphony gitter ^^
