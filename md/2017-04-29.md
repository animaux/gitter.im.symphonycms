@animaux couldn't you just include the entry ID in the reflection to force
uniqueness?

Custom event filters seems to be one of the secrets of symphony lacking docs
or tuts. Are there any examples around?

Powerful, but tricky. I could create some skeleton/example code for you. That
might be a start. But it would mean that you owe me something. :-)

I have created some example code for you, including debug possibilities. It's
just an extension driver, so you still have to create an extension with it
(basically create the folder and the meta XML).

You have mail.

Super. I just noticed that I have done the same some years ago. So here is
another code example (dated 2013):

FYI: The Email Template Manager (ETM), the Email Newsletter Manager (ENM) and
the Unique Upload Field extension should now work fine on PHP7. When Symphony
2.7 gets released, there will be new versions of ETM and ENM that allow
"optional attachments" for emails (pretty useful if your emails are based on a
section with optional Upload fields).
