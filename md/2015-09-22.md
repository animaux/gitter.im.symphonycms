@nitriques looking at Datetime - is the only reason we send the ‘timestamp’ to
php to convert the timestamp into a valid date string? Or is there any other
reason?

@jonmifsud I am not sure that I understand what you are saying... DateTime
stores everything as a timestamp...

ah sorry - I’ve more or less figured something out - not sure if its clean but
seems to work.

____

my question was this - when you click on a date -there’s an ajax request to
the server to get back a ‘date string’ which is used within the Input Field

____

the user-friendly date (also the date sent by POST I’d imagine)

no prob. I’ll see if I can get ranges to work - normal time I’ve managed… had
to re-calculate the offset with the ones from symphony and in some cases
reverse the change. I’m sure you’ll find something to improve if I get to PR
stage

so then I could work on the Hour offsets :) because it was a pain to
debug/test with an offset of 6 hours

setting a default time when using pre-populate is too easy :) strtotime (
‘5am’) puts the time to 5am. need to figure out why the end time is 1 hour
more not same time.
