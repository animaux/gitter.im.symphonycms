@nitriques I’m trying to add some ‘custom’ filtering for an Administration
Page in symphony (generated by an extension) I’ve kind-of managed to do most
of the UI by copying the standard filtering HTML, but I can’t quite figure out
how to add a ‘calendar’ UI to it. I’ve tried adding an item with class
‘calendar’ but it doesn’t seem to work pretty sure I’m missing something.

Basically I have a report which the client wants to generate between two dates
and I’d like to keep the same look and feel of the normal filtering any
tips/ideas would be appreciated.

@jonmifsud check out the Widget::Calendar method to generate it :)

ah -_- I thought it was something which kind of auto-generated with the UI.

No the ui is javascript based ;)

actually I think my problem is the UI not starting...

____

html includes `<div class="calendar" data-calendar="date" data-format="DD MMM
YYYY"></div>` when I use the widget but it’s not filling up

____

do I need to call the init function of the calendar UI?

Yes you may need to call the jquery plugin, but the data attributes are
required
