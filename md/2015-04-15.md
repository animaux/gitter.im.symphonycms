morning! I got a 'Entity 'nbsp' not defined in Entity' error with the search
index. It seems the datasource fails on nbsp

____

Is there any workaround without checking all the content?

k for now I did a quick search and replace in the database. But I'm still open
for suggestions to prevent this in the future. I use redactor editor for this
website and that has a function '''$string = str_replace(' ', '&#160;',
$string);''' So I expected that all nbsp were changed.

In XML/XSLT, if you want to use entities other than the predefined entities
(AFAIK: `&amp;`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&quot;`, `&apos;`), you must explicitely
declare them at the top of your stylesheet.

    
    
    <!DOCTYPE xsl:stylesheet  [
        <!ENTITY nbsp   "&#160;">
        <!ENTITY euro   "&#8364;">
        <!ENTITY uuml   "ü">
        <!ENTITY ouml   "ö">
        <!ENTITY auml   "ä">
    ]>

I don't know, however, why the datasource produces such an output. I have no
experience with the Search Index extension.

Doesn't seems to be a workaround when I place it in my master template

Hmmm, I think you might need it in the stylesheet which has the matching
template for the node in question.

Would $string = str_replace(' ', '&#160;', $string);' not be $string =
str_replace('  ', '&#160;', $string);'? Just interested in learning a bit
mysefl :)

____

$string = str_replace( ' ', '&#160;', $string);'

____

Oh, ignore me this text field is replacing  &-n-b-s-p-; as we enter the text.

@michael-e I will try that later. @munki-boy I'm the biggest learner if it
goes around this kind of 'back-end' stuff :D

I've tried it on the page template, master and sub templates. But no effect.
When I enter a keyword in the search field the result page load with the error
when an article has the nbsp

Hmmm, OK, strange. Do you know if there is any XSLT transformation in the
extension's datasource? What does the error message say? In which file does it
happen?

        loadXML():
            Entity 'nbsp' not defined in Entity, line: 769
            /home/degoede/domains/degoedevastgoedonderhoud.nl/public_html/symphony/lib/toolkit/class.xsltprocess.php:149

____

it only happens with keywords that are indexed with search_index

____

Any other word loads the page normally

____

So it could be possible that it is the search_index datasource which throws
the error or doesnt replace the nbsp

____

But as said above I m not a backender/php coder. More a curious learner ;-)

I am very sure that it is the search index datasource. AFAIK, the Symphony
core will always prevent this from happening. Unfortunately I don't know
exactly how it works, and I have no time to investigate this issue. @brendo
will know better. Maybe you should as well post the issue on the extension's
bug tracker.
