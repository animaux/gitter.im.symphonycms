@nitriques have a collegue whoâ€™s getting `logged out` of the backend on a
local copy of a particular Symphony-based website. No problems on my local nor
on the server. Other installs work just fine. Any idea what we could/should be
looking for?

we have a `.dev` domain - trying to switch him to a non-local mysql server as
it seems to be part of the problem
