~~Will do!~~

____

Oh, too late!

____

Would have done!

____

So this is fixed in  michael-e/email_template_manager@6096bfe already?

____

_Impressive!_

____

I cannot use validation in this case, since the client is simply pasting a
huge list of recipients. But they are informed …

Yes, this fix prevents the ETM template properties from being completely
empty. This in turn means that you will get a more useful error in the ENM
newsletter log.

My server info =>  
PHP => 7.0.28-0  
ubuntu => 16.04.1  
MySql => 14.14

____

What I already tried = >  
1 - Cleared cookies and browser history  
2 - Cleared file cache and DB cache  
3 - Disabled xsrf in the config (then when I log in, it redirects back to the
login)

Can someone please advice how to solve this issue when I try to update
Symphony =>  
`Fatal Error: Could not complete upgrading. MySQL returned: 1292: MySQL Error

@wdebusschere I can remember I solved this before, but nothing seems to work
this time.  
I have set a Non-Zero date for the entries, but that doesn't solved the issue.  
Can someone please help ?

____

Even though there 're no entries with Zero dates in Column `creation_date`
it's giving the same error.
