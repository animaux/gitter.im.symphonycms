If I may, you should make a bundle with complex theme , to display true
abilities of symphony.  
porting WP **Hueman** [link](https://hr.wordpress.org/themes/hueman) would be
a good idea.  
That one is among best free themes and it is interesting and complex.  
And of course , clearer documentation - on which you're working, and FAQ would
be good moves.  
that's just my 2 cents. :pensive:
