Actually I have an "unofficial" (local, client) branch of the Email Template
Manager which allows email attachments and "from" header configuration (the
latter being the reason why it has never been merged — faking the sender is
not allowed with most mailboxes). Regarding attachments, I thought about
adding this funtionality to the public release. Attachments could then be
added using local paths like `/workspace/media/foo.pdf`.

____

But yes, it 's also possible with the core email API directly.

:clap: I would be happy to test it. Have some projects where I was manually
adding in attachments via tha API; would like to see how we can streamline
without the extra customisation every time.

____

I think From header changes are `fine` as long as they’re well explained.
would be nice to be able to send from `myemail@mydomain.com` instead of
`general@mydomain.com`.

The thing is that this confiduration simply changes the header, but NOT the
sender. So you'd still send from `general@mydomain.com`, using
`myemail@mydomain.com` in the FROM header. Believe me, most mailboxes would
not accept such an email.

yes they should be fine; both in production environments. One gets used all

Give me some minutes to wrap my mind around it. Maybe hours – I am terribly
slow today, the brain power meter says 20 percent or so. :-)

Yep. I will have to leave the house soon, but I will definitely take a look
later! I may have to revert your commit and release a new version if I can't
fix it soon. (People shouldn't pull a broken version.)

I did a lot to fight high server load! At the moment I have just a few slow
database queries remaining, and the server could handle more than 10 times the
load. I could handle the average load with a single processor core.

____

But as I said, it was a long way to have such low load.

server (nginx). And I use some "custom queries".
