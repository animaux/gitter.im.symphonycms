textboxfield and multiligual_field extensions. Ah; I've just thought of
something: I might downgrade both of these (rather than using the latest
versions) to see what happens

if you only serve the site in one language you could migrate and remove it.

No; the site's only in English. They _were_ thinking of making it multilingual
but decided not to do it, so they have 102 fields which use the multilingual
but they want to switch back to single language

ah! so THAT'S what the tbl_ prefix means. In the client's DB, the prefix is
sym - I didn't realise that's what it meant. So Symphony is altering the SQL
somewhere down the pipeline?

would a helper function override the fields processRawFieldData() function?
