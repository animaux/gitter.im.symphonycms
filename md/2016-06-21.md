Hey guys, I think this is going to appeal to a lot of Symphony people doing
heavy custom work, <https://github.com/pointybeard/symphony-classmapper>

____

Written by  @pointybeard, but it essentially abstracts `EntryManager` so you
can naturally write new entries

____

Eg.

    
    
      $article = (new Article())
            ->title("My Article Title")
            ->body("The article body")
            ->date("now")
            ->save();

Does anyone around here work with cacheable data sources in conjunction with
front-end forms? I'm having trouble with cache invalidation after a user
posted from the front-end: the cache stays intact although it should be
deleted.

I don’t do the conjunction part… does the version you are using usually
invalidate stuff when updated? I know most versions for cachableds just had an
expiry time

Yes, if I create, update or delete an entry from the backend, the cache is
invalidated correctly. Just the front-end part doesn't seem to work.

But yeah, I 'd tread carefully at the moment with PHP 7. The problems

Due to that question I was looking into the generateSalt function. Does it
matter that we're only using values derived from microtime and the (total!)
memory in bytes? I'm reading up on salting now...

____

(And is it right that we use the system 's total memory rather than the memory
allocated to the script? I think both can potentially be found by attackers
iirc from watching a video a few months back.)

____

We use `memory_get_usage(true)` \- <http://php.net/manual/en/function.memory-
get-usage.php> ,
<https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/blob/2.7.x/symphony/lib/toolkit/class.cryptography.php#L98>

____

Using `mycrypt_create_iv()` seems to be the suggestion.
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2513734/generating-a-salt-in-php> ,
<http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.mcrypt-create-iv.php> . I don't know if
the mcrypt extension being required would be a problem for some users - I
would think not.

Yes, the correct behaviour would be the clearing of both section (1 and 5).
We've got a combined registration form that stores some information in section
1 and other in section 5. So yes, not clearing section 5's cache is the
problem.

This reset `$this->_sectionsToFlush = array();` also feels like it wouldn't be
necessary

____

So I 'd set `private $_sectionsToFlush = null;` to be just an empty array

____

and then update the logic so that is doesn 't override values

____

essentially each time `__fetchSectionsFromContext` runs, it should not remove
anything from `_sectionsToFlush`, just add things

Maybe that 'll help you in the meantime, otherwise I can take a look in a bit

Uh, I never checked

I 've got values like `cache-age="5649s"` which sound reasonable in the

What happens if you add this line `$xml = preg_replace('/cache-
age=[\'\"]fresh[\'\"]/', 'cache-age=\''.$file_age.'s\'', $xml);`

____

About 226, there will be something similar

shall I flush the cache?

the single quotes look a bit strange in the context of the XML. Is that valid?

Hi there, is anyone good with the extension api, trying to figure out how to
access a configuration setting from a js script on the backend

oh I think you will first need to add that option to the JS via php. They are
not available by default.

how would you do that, or is there any way to create the js variables through
adding a inline script / raw html code to the header, i know theres the
Administration::instance()->Page->addScriptToHead method but that for files

symphonycms/symphony-2#2604 for installer stuff, very much WIP

____

@Huttch You could use `addElementToHead` and just add a raw script

eg.

____

    
    
     $this->addElementToHead(
                    new XMLElement('script', json_encode({ id: '1'}), array(
                        'type' => 'application/json'
                    ))
    );

____

where `json_encode` can be whatever you like

____

And you are in the context of `AdministrationPage`
