Hey guys maybe someone has already come across this issue before. When using
the ninja technique (apply templates) the html output seems to be adding
whitespace in between inline elements. client just pointed it out. Any idea
how to get around it?

@munki-boy Thanks for the precision, I'll have to check with my government
(which may take years)

____

@jonmifsud I ALWAYS use

____

    
    
    <xs l:output method="html" 
        omit-xml-declaration="yes"
        encoding="UTF-8"
        indent="no" />

which removes all non necessary white spaces

the "traditional" way to do it would be to set font-size: 0 and line-height:0
on the parent element

____

and reset font-sizes on the child

basically the html came all without whitespace except where I have the inline
stuff. I’ll try the inline block stuff

    <p>With horror, I read recently about the Lithuanian state’s attempt to hide its history of Nazi collaboration —

it comes broken up like that, it’s not normal right? (maybe I have something
wrong somewhere)

@nitriques I think that doesn’t work for me since the issue is with likns and
paragraphs :/ issue is basically when there’s a link with a fullstop after it.
They don’t want the extra white space (important for a news provider)

Using strip whitespace I only get so far. I addeed “Linklovely” before and
after each <a> tag using the ninja technique, could the apply-templates be
adding a whitespace? database has no whitespace but the XML (debug and debug-
raw) have it

____

so how do you deal with markdown anchor tags?

____

or other inlines?

either side.

____

Markdown extra w smarty pants

it’s something with conversion to XML/XSLT

hmm will try - though doubt it will do anything. if just fetches from the DB

____

I was going to see if I can get the XML/parser to remove whitespace not sure
if that would have an impact

____

weird editing xmlelement- >generate to force indent to false seems to ‘solve’
the issue

not great for debugging though

I'm late to the party again, does anyone know a good solution for importing
local content. Like the old CSV importer. I might have to port product data
into entries.
