Hey Folks, I've been getting an error from the oembed_field extension when
handling a YouTube URL `Exception occurred: Failed to parse oEmbed data:
Symphony could not parse XML from oEmbed remote service`

____

I have the latest version from <https://github.com/Solutions-
Nitriques/oembed_field>

____

Any pointers on the best way to debug this?

@jean-luc sometimes, the youtube oembed api is down. you can test the query by
looking up the url in the youtube driver

____

Currently get `Unauthorized`

____

Ah, perhaps embedding isn 't allowed on that video

____

Seems to work ok with this example

Ah yeah that's another option.Maybe we should add a message telling the user
to check if it's embedable... (?)

____

If you ever feel like poking at this, I can help ;)

Might be a way to stop it choking when the response is not XML

____

As currently it prevents the entry for saving

____

Will have a poke around

Indeed. We can detect the 401 and just show a warning, not an actual error
