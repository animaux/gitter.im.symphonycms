@nimanthaharshana This extension is also helpful to make a json page:

You need to convert the xml to json with the utility or with own code

@animaux I have done steps 2,3,4 but I'm not sure of how to proceed from
there. Do I need to use an utility ?

@nimanthaharshana I think you will need one. Either one of the available or
something you knit together yourself. There are probably some tutorials around
that are not symphony-specific.

I think that should be possible, but I’d rather use a different file in order
not to bork things up.

Somewhere in `/workspace/`

@wdebusschere I’ve used that in some cases. It depends on your use case. Most
of the time when I was creating extensions which I did not want to make
dependant on hard coded changes. They were essentially preferences.
