If there’s someone around who is as annoyed as me about `Lucida grande` on Mac
OS X having a shorter `ndash` and a longer `hyphen`: I have a nice CSS-snippet
to fix that :) @nilshoerrmann ?

Spam is getting quite annoying in the forum. I’m happy to delete it and the
users, but I wonder if we should invest a few minutes in securing the login
procedure. I guess @nitriques might have plans for the site anyway?

Don't ask — wasn't his idea to shut it down? He just kept it because so many
people wanted it.

Yeah I think we need to close this and the extensions also.

If closing, I think there should definitely be a publicly searchable archive.
It's mostly how I learnt and understood Symphony + XSLT/XPath by example.

I’m all for closing the extensions part in favor of symphonyextensions.com but
the forum … hmmm.

I’d rather close gitter `:D`

AFAIK, the forum is an adventurous hack, and the fact that it still works is
_Wonder of the World number 8_. And only without it, the website could be re-
built from the ground.

____

Regarding the  "learning aspect": Yes and no. I also learnt a lot from the
forum, but meanwhile a lot of information is no longer true or valuable. And
another part of it is not strictly necessary if you buy the right book
instead. (For example, taking XSLT code from the forum may solve certain
issues, but it won't teach you much. Reading the XSLT 1.0 Pocket Reference by
Evan Lenz will help much more in the long run.)

Hmn, the world might end if we shut it down.

____

You’re right. But a lot of problems/solutions in the forum are symphony-
specific. Should not be a problem to archive it’s content anyway.

Time is clearly a commodity we all lack, but if the info is _useful_ then
archiving it somewhere and somehow adding the useful parts back into the
documentation in time. It may even be able to condense down the discussions to
a basic FAQ.

@nitriques Gitter search is bit painful (in the web browser at least) but a
Google search appending the modifier `site:gitter.im/symphonycms` is quite
helpful.

if you find it hard to stay on top of all your github notifications (I sure
do) this is pretty nice: <https://octobox.io/>
