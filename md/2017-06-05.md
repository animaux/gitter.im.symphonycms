Hopefully someone's still awake. :) I've restored my database to its
pre-`2.7.x` state to test the upgrade process, but when I now browse to
`/install/` I get the home page. O.o Any ideas?

does the install dir still exist? If you previously upgraded it might be
removed.

Ugh, here's a rewrite rule in `.htaccess` that ignores directories and sends
them to `index.php`.

The public directory on this vagrant VM is separate and has symlinks to the
directories in it.

OK, solved that one at least.
