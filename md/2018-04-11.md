Hey everyone, would anyone be interested in a 6mo contract for creating a
system built on Symphony? We are potentially taking on a big contract and need
an extra pair of hands.

A quick question,

In rich text redactor it has following code in the content.imageupload.php
file (Not a class)

`$root = Symphony::Configuration()->get('imagepath','redactor');
General::realiseDirectory($root);`

I'm trying to do the same in my extension, particularly an AJAX call, but it's
returning me the following error =>

Class 'Symphony' not found

Can someone please help ?

@Huttch you can use the member extension and a couple of sections events

section event can have  "filters" and the member extensions provide those

Hi guys, after login to the Symphony backend (v2.7.4) I get a 'Request was
rejected for having an invalid cross-site request forgery token.' error
message and I don't know how to overcome it, never had this state before. It
happens only on my localhost development pc website version, on production
server everything's fine. Is there anything I can check or delete to reset
this state?I believe it started some time after I pushed the website to the
production server, but I dunno.
