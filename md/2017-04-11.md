@animaux Did you manage to solve the importing to multiple sections custom
datasource in the end? looking through old posts here and you seem to have a
few code snippets posted. Just wondering if you found a confirmed solution
that worked for you?

@brendo Is it possible to override the processRawFieldData function in members
password field so the password being migrated isn't double encoded at all?

@andrewminton the latter is possible but I don’t recall if the salt functions
might be different (which might impact your passwords from working) - however
when you say override I think your best bet ight be editing it for the import
and re-setting it after.

If the password value exposed via XML for import to newer system is the hashed
value from DB, I can't see a way to unsalt a one way PWD even with good
intentions.

@michael-e 's importcsv alteration seems to have a function to reset pwd, but
that's triggering a frontend action surely?

I can't recall that I changed anything in that file apart from the code
formatting.

I'm in a sub folder symphony build doing a test with your branch and it just
seems to freeze on the import screen :(

____

Do you think this will import hashed passwords directly to the DB?

____

Without - re-encoding/double-encoding them that is.

Nope, I never tried this. And if it freezes, try to disable XSRF protection
(i.e. set `enable_xsrf` to `no`. As far as I remember, it doesn't work with
XSRF tokens.

Ok thanks, That alteration didn't seem to make a difference for some reason :(

I respect the need to maintain passwords in their encrypted form, but
migrating members seems to be a pain in the ass.

`UNKNOWN: ErrorException 0 - Illegal string offset 'password' on line 531 of
/extensions/members/fields/field.memberpassword.php` Members seems to expect
an array of 'password' here, but we only provide a srting

If I alter the processRawFieldData function in the memberspassword.php file
tempararily to accept a string `$password = trim($data)` instead of `$password
= trim($data['password'])` it seems to import the pwd correctly. progress at
least. :P
