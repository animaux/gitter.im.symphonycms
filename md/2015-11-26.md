@nitriques quick question, do you use the not: functionality in Association
Fields or Tag fields? was modifying some functionality for the tag field and
noticed that the negation might not be entirely correct on the association
field.

I don’t think tag field has negation by default...

____

at least the one which comes with the core

PR now.

the association field has support for

sql: Null  
sql: NOT NULL  
not:  
sql-null-or-not:

____

you think we should have the same full set for tags?

____

and another thing (because this might be a variation) if an item has multiple
tags. If I use one of the not: variations, it should not pull up that item
right? (even if it has other tags/relations)

I find tags a really quick way to sort content, I'd like to have the
functionality... after I google 'sql-null-or-not:'

sql: Null  
sql: NOT NULL  
not:  
sql-null-or-not:

____

I mean all of those right? or the not: on it’s own doesn’t make sense?
