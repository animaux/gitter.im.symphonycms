@alexnantel88 Thanks. It’s hard to avoid ending up in a huge endless
discussion. We had some many of those with people who mostly left the

be able to make sound design decisions. In other words: you are very free to

Sorry for being unclear: I'm talking about the SMTP gateway provided by
Symphony using a Gmail address.

____

The gateway worked fine for years and I 'm investigating the cause of the
error: either a Symphony update or a change on Google's side.

Is it possible to use the Remote Data Source to create URL's from the Remote

As an example, taking an RSS feed, take the //item/title and append it to
$root URL? Then parse as normal with xsl the content on my domain.

@nilshoerrmann Unknown email gateway error is often caused by incorrect host
or port settings. However, I don't know if Google has changed anything. How is
the configuration (host/port/ssl setting)?

@nilshoerrmann is it a Gsuite account ? You may have to 1) Allow "unsecured

____

@peterfleck_twitter it depends on the trust you put into the RSS feed... I
have many websites which offers both a "list view" and a "detailed view"
