Anyone know of a repeatable field extension? Pretty much the Meta Keys
extension, but one that doesn't require a key/value pair, and one that can add
regex like email, image etc. There's the Dynamic Text Group extension but it
looks ancient, and from memory it was quite buggy anyway.

____

I might just copy/modify the Meta Keys extension

@jonmifsud that would be very helpful. @nitriques I need to render a value
from the database into an input field so that the user can see the existing
value and edit it if they would like to.

Folks. Iâ€™ve run across an error in a long-time-often-updated symphony
installation currently on `2.7.0` and `PHP 7`: Whenever I empty an `input
field` or a `text field` the empty field is not saved but it retains the
former value.

____

Could this be a DB-issue?

Changing fields works, but empty fields are not stored.

____

How can I do that?

when you submit switch on the inspector (network tab)

____

make sure you have set it to show all requests and not clear per page view

____

then find the post request before the 301 and confirm it shows up. (hopefully
not a browser quirk and data goes through)

____

if data goes through as it should itâ€™s likely a symphony change/tweak

I donâ€™t think I have a 2.7 set up right now as Iâ€™d cross check that.

@jonmifsud `POST` does seem to contain all the fields, including the empty
one.

____

@cylkee Thanks, that seems to be the issue.

____

@stuartgpalmer Can you decode the value using javascript ?

My pleasure ;) But it's a problem the dynamic field should try to resolve...
Does it have a cdata option ?

I've created a new extension, Dynamic Text Field. It allows the user to add as
many lines of text fields as they like. E.g my current use case is for
features, which are stylised in a way that having a textbox won't work. Check
it out and let me know you're thoughts
