just testing with the integration branche

__ __

a direct call to the script does work
`index.php?mode=jit&param=2/1650/550/5/img/image-000-1484831781.png`

__ __

but on the page it gets the type octet-stream

Ok I answered my own questions :smile:

  * jit 2.0 can run on nginx with the rewrite rule`rewrite ^/image/(.+.)$ /index.php?mode=jit&param=$1 last;` @cmnstmntmn
  * jit 2.0 has cache control, you can even set it in the config with max_age
  * jit 2.0 does have some issues like the strange defects

Hahaha just added some lines from 2.0 to the 1.x version and than I found:
symphonycms/jit_image_manipulation@70103eb

__ __

It only got the same error as symphonycms/jit_image_manipulation#146

__ __

but caching is available in jit from 1.45

@nitriques made a pull request for it: symphonycms/jit_image_manipulation#156.

Maybe also add the options in the 1.x branche, like
<https://github.com/symphonycms/jit_image_manipulation/tree/integration#options?>

Sorry @moretaste @animaux I've made a mistake (merging Brendan's work in the
integration branch) which resulted in a poor 2.0.0 release... I'll try to fix
it ASAP. But you know, open source is driven by business needs...

@nitriques `integration` is _kind of_ `2.1.0`?
