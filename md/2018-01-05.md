Hi, how do I take a select statement that's been stored as a string in , say,
`$the-string` e.g. `'//example/entry/value'` and convert the statement so that
I can use it with `<xsl:value-of select="$the-string" />`. Is it possible with
a XSLT/XPATH function? I thought maybe `id()` but that doesn't appear to work.

@cylkee you can create a variable xsl:variable and reuse it then with xsl
:value-of

@wdebusschere That's not quite what I'm trying to achieve. In the above case,
it just outputs "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy
//example/entry/value" to the HTML. But I want it to take what's in `$the-
string` and use the select statement in there to hunt for the actual value.

Has anyone used Symphony with Maria DB? One of our clients hosts has just
upgraded PHP to version 7 and migrated from MySQL to Maria DB without telling
us! We can get around the PHP issue, but it would be great to know if Maris DB
will work before I do that work. Thanks

Problem is, itâ€™s a combination of letters and numbers. Currently it sorts like
this:

  * BLA-100
  * BLA-20
  * BLA-9

Wheras a number-aware sort order should be like this:

  * BLA-9
  * BLA-20
  * BLA-100

I just read that in MySQL you can **cast** values used in `order by` clauses.
So a custom field might be able to do what you are looking for.

In this particular case it is a reflection field. So I would even be able to
access all the segments of the string individually. But since it is only
possible to sort by a single field in the backend, thatâ€™s not really helping.

Yes, but regarding the sorting of the actual output it behaves exactly like a
regular input field

____

I could, but only on a single one. I would have to sort by a hierarchy of
fields then.

the reflection field and adds some custom sorting magic... That would mean
some work.

Kids are in bed â€¦ not asleep yet though â€¦ this looks like what Iâ€™ll need:
<https://stackoverflow.com/a/33138919/1520177>

____

But from the logic of it, it will only work with a single occurance of a
number in the string. Bwahh, itâ€™s complicated again.

____

So another approach could be an extension that lets you generate a sort order
hierarchy for a section. E. G.

### Sort by

  1. Artist
  2. Year
  3. Album
  4. Track Number

Each Number being a pulldown.
