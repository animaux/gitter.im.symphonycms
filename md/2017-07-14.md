Hi @nitriques. Just to clarify what was said in the blog post; should I
migrate to `lts` branch to stay on 2.7.X version of Symphony as `master` will
become 3.0 in time?

the `lts` branch is analogous to the `master` branch, as it is a release
branch. The commits in those branches will never change and never get rebased,
so it is the safest place to pull your things from. But you will eventually
get new major version in those branches, so if you want to ALWAYS be on a
particular major version, you should use `2.7.x` branch. You'll then get the
most up to date, yet to be released versions, but never a new major nor minor
(only patches). If you want reproductible build, I would suggest to checkout
specific tags. You will always get the same commit as HEAD.

tl;dr:  
`master` = latest major (i.e 2.x.x or 3.x.x)  
`lts` = current lts minor (i.e. 2.7.x)  
`2.7.x` = dev branch for 2.7.x  
`2.7.0`= precise 2.7.0 release. This is the only one that guarantees NO CHANGE
EVER.

All other branches might move.

only fishes and beer.

must be nice to unplug for a while @nitriques

question: is there a way to access the parameter pool from within a
datasource? I know I can set a parameter, but can I retrieve one in the
execute() function?

I don't understand that `$param_pool` variable. In the docs it says 'The
current parameter pool that this Datasource can use when filtering', but
var_dump returns an empty array. I have to use the `$_env` variable to
retrieve them... What's the point in the `$param_pool` variable?

The param pool is something like "the array to pass params from one data
source to another data source". (It's about chaining data sources.)

Inside the `execute` function the `$param_pool` contains the same values as
`$this->_env['env']['pool']`. All other params ("page parameters") are in
`$this->_env['param']`.

I admit that this is very confusing, and it took me ages to understand this.
Well, you know, "naming things" is very hard, and in this case it didn't turn
out wellâ€¦
