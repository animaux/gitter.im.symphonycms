Hey Kirk, I still need the user to see the entry for reference just not be
able to edit certain fields.

@andrewminton you could make the visible one a reflection field, I think no
changes would be saved

Good thinking. But they'd need to be able to create the entry first.. then
once entry has been saved only be able to view it.. it's a records/sensitive
notes taking section so needs visibility. This is more of an Author Roles type
scenario in my head now as we'd still need an admin to edit any errors.. so
will have a bit of a think.

@kirkstrobeck Use this one instead:
<https://github.com/DeuxHuitHuit/flang_redirection> the old one does not work
with the new extensions (FLang + languages are needed)

@andrewminton I need this feature too. If I ever build something that does it,
I'll ping you

@andrewminton Author Roles doesnâ€™t cover that kind of scenario I guess right?
