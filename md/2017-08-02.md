@michael-e @jonmifsud Jens found an interesting XSLT2-Lib, I’ve posted some
links here: <http://www.getsymphony.com/discuss/thread/110276/#position-11>
I’m interested if you guys think this could be something worthwile for
Symphony in the future.

Meanwhile we are talking about XSLT 3.0, right? As far as I see, the mentioned
library doesn't even support all 2.0 elements and functions. :-(
