I guess it is not possible to update a datasource with ajax?

I've got a multilingual product selector and I like to ajaxify the results
when the visitor changes select boxes in a form. That works and isn't that
hard.

But I also have to update the pagination, which I probably can hijack with js.
But I also have to update the form from which the visitor makes the selection
(when I choose value X in filter 1, filter 2 can only contains Y, etc).

... and ofcourse it is a project on a small budget

so what exactly you’re not sure how to tackle? Updating filters depending on
choices in other parts of the form?

yup it is almost a full page reload but the client doesn't want a full page
reload

____

and due to the multilingual it starts being overcomplexed

maybe I must put the effort in the page load time so the client thinks there
isn't a full page reload

I don’t think I’ve tackled linked forms in that way but had plenty of Ajax
with symphony. And I assume you only know the possible options once the
datasource is filtered correct?

If so I’d go with disabling the select/options until the ajax returns.

____

yeah but a full page reload is not necessarily neat, you can however generate
a part of the HTML component/page with the linked datasources (whole form) and
replace it via ajax every time (easy way?)

____

An example of what I mean (fully ajaxified site) <http://realtimeforex.com/>

Find the EUR-USD dropdown in the green area - do not mind the charts stay
loading the ‘client’ closed part of their operations (hopefully it will be
back to working soon as it’s going to be managed by someone else soon)

ah nice, I've tried it that way but got problems with the url params that are
lost after the ajax call

what do you mean? shouldn’t those url-params be part of your form?

so what exactly is lost? because if you keep the params through the form, and
use them on ajax submission you should be fine no? What’s important is to
disable the elements whilst reloading, as then you will lose any updates by
the user (unless you do something fancy).

getting results via ajax?

if you ajax the complete form(s) would that work. Before you’d create ajax
pages you can just do the whole page via Ajax and take out the forms and
replace them see if that works.

____

if you’re using jQuery make sure that you use

    
    
    jQuery( document).on(‘eventName’,’selector’,function(){whatever you do});

____

that will enable your functions to run even if the page contents change

I’ve started to do all my selectors like that, allows them to load at any
point in the page’s lifespan and guarantees that they work

form wasn't responding because I did the normal jQuery('selector')...

mmm I'm stuck again the main page got a parameter to set the language. Based
on that param I do my multilingual. But in the ajax page I miss that param.
