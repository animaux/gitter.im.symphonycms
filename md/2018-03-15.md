A very specific task. I was trying to create a shellscript that renames a set
of folders based on part of a line in a certain file in each folder …

Very special indeed. In this case Stack Overflow is your friend. :-)

Yes … I’ve come quite a long way, but there was always some very unintuitive
showstopper somewhere.

Problem is, I lack some very basic programming skills.

Nomen est omen: Shell scripting is not programming, it's only "scripting". :-)

Most of the time I get this kind of stuff done with a mix of scripting, BBEdit
and Stack Overflowing …

Good thing is, one is always learning

I just gave up and did a _human_ batch-rename. It went a lot faster than
trying to script it. But it still felt wrong. Like »Never send a human to do a
machines job.«. Anyway …

If you have already finished renaming, the human solution was probably the
best. IMHO automization is only useful if something either takes forever or
will repeat, again and again…

For example: managing 920 SSL (Let's Encrypt) certificates on a server, and
automatically writing nginx configuration… I do this (and more crazy stuff)
with shell scripts.
