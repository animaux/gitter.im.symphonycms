@diomed lots of coffee. XSLT is one of those things (like let's say `make` or
`awk`) that seems totally wack, until it flashes. It may take a while. But I
would never go back to anything else

____

But it is on the road map to allow you to use the templating engine you want.

@nitriques there's a small typo here:
<http://www.getsymphony.com/download/releases/version/2.7.5/>

____

It says  "2.7.4" in the text.

I don't understand what the website does here (something with the Referer
header, maybe), but if I am on this page:
<http://www.getsymphony.com/download/>

____

and I click the link in the text  "Fast-acting and long-lasting, …", then I
get a broken ZIP, only 10 kB big.

____

Ah, the anchor element has a `download` attribute!
