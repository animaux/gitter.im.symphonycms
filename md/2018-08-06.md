@ashrimplin The Remote Datasource loads XML from a remote source when it is
called, but does not store any data in the system database itself. The XML
Importer imports data into Symphony Sections, e.g. the Symphony database. The
new version of the importer makes use of the remote datasource since it has
way better XML parsing functionality than the original importer code (please
correct me, if Iâ€™m wrong).
