@nitriques I think I’ve got all filtering working without core changes :D

____

what I will need to do at some point is develop a UI for it… which I think I
had partially done before within the core using the filtering widgets.

Dear Symphonists, anyone around who uses the `Association Field` and has been
looking to set up some if>then filters in the backend? For example an
association to show only published articles.

@jonmifsud I was!

____

Can’t remember which project that was …

____

We ended up teaching the editors instead of having a fool-proof solution which
would have required some filters.

____

A UI for this would be teriffic!

____

I think what we needed was to only show entries linked to a certain section.

I have it all working (no core changes) just missing a ui; config is fairly
simple to set up.

____

@animaux if you need to give it a try/testing, I’d be happy to help you set it
up. That would give another test (other than the ones I have) which would help
with missing docs/explenation to release publically

I actually have a nice page to test it with! It would need to filter only
entries with a certain checkbox set.
