if you need some help let me know - though most certainly not this week; and
next one will be tight…

I am improving an ensemble i did for members with a vue.js front end

____

already updated to vue v2, but still want to improve some logic

____

About a year ago, playing with express and mongo I tryed to set up an
"anonymous" login, I mean, every time you connect to you are authentified, if
it s from a specific device, at a specific IP

then an account level, allow you to connect different IPs and devices to your
user account

____

the proof of concept was ok, but still didn 't make this "user level"
connecting all devices and IPs, only the anonymous login with device+ip

____

but after playing with express and mongo, i fell back in love with symphony ;)

____

but now I just want to improve members authentication workflow for users

I am thinking that login and account creation could be the same form: starting
with a test on login, if email is not found, resending another post request to
create the account

I never thought it s a good idea to rely on FB or Twitter to register users.
If the webservice is free, as FB, then user accounts are the way to evaluate
the value of the website

____

If your accounts are managed by FB, then you grow the value of FB, not your
website

well we don’t really rely on it. but offer it as an ‘extra’ option

____

once a user is registered via FB they can ‘reset’ their password and continue
using the usual ‘members’ extension

we also have option to link their members login with facebook

____

so you can get some other data if it’s useful
