@stuartgpalmer there is this one
<http://symphonyextensions.com/extensions/entry_versions/> I tried it once and
it did seem to work ok. Not sure if that was on `2.6.x` but likely. Still
@jonmifsud and @nitriques will probably wnat to build something from scratch.

Great hanks, I’ll have a look at it!
