Is it doable to serve some specific pages from a website with another
domainname without to much hassle?

A client have a product catalog with several brands and like to serve two
brands with an own domainname and own design but without building seperate
websites. As always budget is low.

will the website have the same structure?

If yes you can use a url-param to switch ‘themes/branding '

if you care only about one domain I would suggest doing a ‘canonical’ link to
the main site.

____

that would mean that the secondary sites won’t turn up in google and any link
juice is passed to the main site

or is it ‘stolen’ from another supplier and sold without consent. If the
former I would suggest a canonical link. If the latter robots / no-index is

@jonmifsud remember you helped me with the date range filter problem some time
ago?

____

Actually there was yet another problem with it,

____

But I could fix it.

____

`first day of next month` actually counts all dates from the current time

____

e. g. if it’s 9 o’clock only dates from the first day of the next month
**after 9:00** will be shown

____

THIS IS SO BLOODY UNINTUITIVE!

____

Argh!

____

But I’m happy it works now. Wouldn’t have gotten it right without your help.
So – many thanks again!

The winner is `first day of next month 00:00 to last day of next month 23:59`

it's the same as with extensions: Not everybody feels obliged to also maintain
