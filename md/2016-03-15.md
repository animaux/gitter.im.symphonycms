there is a xslt utility that made the xml->json translation, works good
actually. I have an ensemble using this and react, the index is the app page,
and have `/api` subpages for the data endpoints in json.

Really getting funky with the remote datasource, I simplify the markup for the
included elements:  
`/ObjectenLijst/Object[contains('{$ds-bestaande-bouw.ObjectSystemID}, {$ds-
bestaande-bouw-random.ObjectSystemID}, {$ds-
virtualtour.ObjectSystemID}',ObjectSystemID)]` Doesn't include the entries
from virtualtour and when I change the parameter in the id's it works like a
charm.

It feels like that parameter doesn't reach the remote datasource before the
remote datasource execute(?)

____

That parameter I mean `{$ds-virtualtour.ObjectSystemID}` I've set caching to
`0` to exclude my first thoughts

____

Even if I only use that parameter there are no results. In debug view it is
one of the last parameter. Is there a way to change the order when a
datasource execute?

a new remotedatasource shows all the results. So it could be the order of
datasources?

____

Yes

____

there are dependencies, but resaving the datasource should fix this out
