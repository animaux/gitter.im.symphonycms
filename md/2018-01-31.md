@animaux nope he’s not ( at least as far as I’m aware of ) though I believe I
did meet him once and Mifsud is fairly common around here :)

Hey guys! I just released a [new
extension](https://github.com/twiro/entry_shortlink) and published a small
[forum (!!!) announcement](http://www.getsymphony.com/discuss/thread/113753/)
for it :) If you use shortlinks to link entries (backend) to pages (frontend)
you might find this useful – if you don't use shortlinks or even no backend
->frontend-links at all you might find this interesting! And if you want to
give feedback or show your apporoach to this topic I would really love to see
it written in the forum (still miss the good old civilized days of structured
and sustainable discussions).
