Hey y'all... I don't know if you saw this post on the forum, but this sounds
exciting XSLT 2.0 with PHP (not the java implementation either)...

Yes I spotted it but didn’t really look into it. So far I’ve been served well
with XSLT 1

nope he wants to give them to developers/agencies who’d take care of them.

symphonists seems like where everything unmantained ends up. (even though we
put an effort to keep things updated)

I’ve no issue with mantaining the Association Stuff, pretty familar with how
they all work now. Though I think at some point we need to get the ‘overall’
community more engaged.

that xslt2 through php feels more like some spam for me and as @jonmifsud said
xslt 1 does do a nice job
