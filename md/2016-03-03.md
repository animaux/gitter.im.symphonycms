@nitriques Using `http://symphonyextensions.com/system/update/…` I get an
array as result reporting success and showing the latest version. But on the
extension page there is still the old one.

____

List/browse view shows the updated version, but strangely not the detail page.

@DavidForster Cool, I've been using your Docker images as a base for testing
Symphony on different platforms :)

____

@animaux Wiktionary is usually very useful for translations as they provide a
list of different meanings for a word. For instance, the word save in this
context would probably mean 'store for future use' =>
