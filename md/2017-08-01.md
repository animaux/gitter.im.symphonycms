It might even take longer â€” left-hand traffic! (I assume that this must be
slower because of the higher level of difficulty.)

Â»Be careful or be roadkill!Â«

____

They do write Â»look leftÂ« and Â»look rightÂ« on the streets, which sometimes
actually helps.

____

Not to forget Â»Mind the gapÂ«.
