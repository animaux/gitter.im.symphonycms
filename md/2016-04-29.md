@michael-e this code works now for me:

    
    
            // SEND EMAIL
                $template = EmailTemplateManager::load('template-name');
                $template->addParams(
                    array(
                        'etm-entry-id' => $entry_id,
                    )
                );
                $output = $template->render();
    
                try {
                  $email = Email::create();
                  $email->recipients = array(
                      'John Doe' => 'john@doe.com',
                  );
                  $email->subject   = $output['subject'];
                  $email->text_plain = $output['plain'];
                  $email->text_html  = $output['html'];
    
                  $email->send();
                } catch (EmailGatewayException $e) {
                    throw new SymphonyErrorPage('Error sending email. ' . $e->getMessage());
                } catch (EmailException $e) {
                    throw new SymphonyErrorPage('Error sending email. ' . $e->getMessage());
                }

The setVariable in the email part I had to change. But thanks again!

@nitriques / @michael-e any idea if it’s possible to do something like `if
checkbox 1 = no or checkbox1 = yes and checkbox2=yes` via a standard
datasourish way? Without having to rebuild the whole query?

I actually changed the checkboxes to a select box, which solves the issue kind
of.. but interested to know if anyone did something

@moretaste: Why have you changed the setting of the variables? Has it not
worked as suggested?

@jonmifsud: No, I don't think what you asked for can be achieved easily. (The
thing I had in mind was different, it was _manipulating the filters based on
page parameters_.)

I see three ways to solve such an issue. **First** is: Build you own DS with a
custom query and custom XML — hard, but effective. **Second**: Try and build
your custom logic using chained data sources — native, but ineffective.
**Third**: Use the SymQL extension which eases building custom queries and
adds "OR" logic — conceptually appealing, but I strongly recommend against it,
because it has been the reason for most of the performance issues in my "big
system".

@michael-e thought so; if they `want` checkboxes I’ll add some JS to the
backend page, which would manipulate the selectbox. By far the simplest
solution. I’d do the First option but tight on time...

thanks for your thoughts on it though

Sounds very reasonable to me. Even the JS solution — it may be simpler to
maintain, for example. :-)

Hmmm, thanks for the info! I thought that everything uses these accessor
functions now, but that seems not the case. Perfect job for me for a rainy

the error.

@michael-e maybe this is something you came across; I don’t recall if/how I
might have fixed it. Possible to have an `SQL: null` or `static` filter in a
seletbox (same field)

__ __

I don’t feel like making a massive query to add data to show the ‘expected’
state of all existing values in the database. I’ve tried using a `,` and a `+`
with no success

@jonmifsud I've done this with a "normal DS" but added few lines in php to
manipulate the filter array

quite effective, no xml or SQL to do

That's what I was referring to above, manipulating the filter array before
actually executing the DS. But @jonmifsud wanted to filter based on field
values (which are not available before executing), not parameters or so.

You can poke the entrymanager in the ds to make your filters ;)

<https://gist.github.com/nitriques/959d77492c22b282e8c1084a591c531c>

__ __

it does not poke at the entry manager, but it uses some custom code to set the
section and filters of the DS

__ __

See line 95 where the magic starts ;) the the getSource implementation

__ __

we first created the data source with the editor and customize it a little

__ __

no SQL, no XML poking juste logic and arrays

Hmmm. All I see is `env` values (parameters and such), but nothing like "this
filter works like this if the field value is like this". Maybe I just don't
get the magic?

__ __

Ah, I think I get it! You are using two datasources, the second one being some
sort of "slave" of the first one, using the same source section! Actually the
params used in the second datasource are being output by the first one.

Yup micheal: there are 2 sections with the same data model ;)

but one could use the entry manager to fetch things (i use env params)
