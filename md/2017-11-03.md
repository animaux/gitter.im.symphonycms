Hi all, I'm creating another extension which is using AJAX to update a value
on the fly. It's from within the Entry Edit interface, I have it posting and
updating the field fine. Trouble is, all other fields lose their values... not
sure why. I tried adding an id to the data with the entry ID, but that didn't
matter. Any suggestions?

Do I need to loop over every field? seems verbose

@pixelninja If other fields lose their values maybe you are submitting empty
values.. check in the google developer console what you are submitting.

I'm not passing any value for any other field, just one field only. I would
have thought that only the fields included in the post data would be updated.

Like on the Index pages for example, and you select a row then use the 'with-
selected' menu to update it, it only updates that field. Uses the Apply event
of course, not the Save event. I'll dig around those core events a bit...

Couldn't see how to do it using Symphony events. Ended up creating my own
update database query.
