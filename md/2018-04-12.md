@jurajkapsz deleting your cookie should fix this

Or have 2 separate files and symlink the right one for each environment

@pixelninja @nitriques I've tried to set enable_xsrf to no, but then it just
redirected me back to login form after log in. But to delete cookies helped
and maybe along with restarting local httpd which I did actually for other
reasons, but before that when I just deleted cookies and relaunched my browser
I got the same error result. This was interesting, never had this before, so I
was wondering, though I was just doing the usual routine with websites
deployment (or I like to think so). Thanks very much guys!

@jurajkapsz do you multiple Symphony on your local machine on the same
"hostname" ?

@nitriques I have many Symphony installs on local machine but each has its own
virtual host. Maybe I messed up something around the time of deployment,
because my local (virtual hosts) and production domains are in general the
same on the first and second domain level, being different at the third level.
But I can't think of what.
