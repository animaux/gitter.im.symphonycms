Does anyone alter the backend styling, and if so what's the preferred method?
Someone wants a cartoon with a speech bubble "type the title here", well it's
not that bad but almost :)

I 'm thinking to just overwrite some stuff using grunt and if a breaking
change came in an update it could just default back to the official styling.

I don’t do that but my preferred method would be a PHP extension, which adds a
custom stylesheet

i will keep all your work distinct from the core, no hacking. If there’s a
major change you just update your stylesheet if something looks off.
