@wdebusschere not sure if it’s the best approach, but works great for this:
<https://github.com/symphonists/incrementnumberfield>

____

I’m using it on a site for exactly this use.

Use a special DS that only this particular user can see and increment the
count.

@animaux Thanks for the suggestion. We need to store this for each member, so
2000 comments / 40 users (Production planning application) + would use Ajax.
Anyone would recommend to write a custom event an create a static file for
each user? Because with symphony = 2.000x40 = 80.000 records..

Hmm. Custom is likely to be more effective/economic.

____

You could also store the IDs of read comments in users profiles. But that
could get bloated too.

Got +/- 500 comments / month

____

Yes, was thinking about a tag field or textarea with all ids, but storing
10.000 id 's..

Or the other way round.

____

Store the IDs of the users that have read the comment in the comment itself.

With 40 users that shouldn’t get too fat I’d think. As a link/association.

link/association is difficult as users can grow

Is it not just ids stored?

PHP/Extension guys: I’m trying to get the `uploadselectbox` to give the option
to NOT select any file in the selected folder. I guess I’d have to add another
option in the array. Problem is, I have no idea how. It is filled with the
file list:

____

    
    
             foreach($states['filelist'] as $handle => $v){
                $options[] = array(General::sanitize($v), in_array($v, $data['file']), $v);
            }

Ok, I managed to do so. Not sure if it’s a programatically clean way, but it
works `;)`

If anyone needs an `uploadselectboxfield` with the option NOT to select a
file, you can find it [here](https://github.com/animaux/uploadselectboxfield)

@michael-e @fhamon in the end, the PR for 2.7.x will land in 3.0.0 for sure
