All the sudden, I am having the following issue with my Symphony 2.3.6 install
when I try to access a particular section.

In that section, I have the following fields, title (text input), description
(textarea), buttons (dynamic text group), date start (datetime), date expires
(datetime), banner image (subsection manager), order (order entries)

oh it’s dynamic text group :)

____

missed the query down bottom - is that intended to sort by the dynamic text
group field? seems a weird thing to sort by

> sorting issue it seems

I have been trying to resort by other fields to see if that would fix it... I
added `?sort={fieldidnumber}&order=asc` and I still get the same error. Any
other thoughts on where I could reset the sorting?

____

It shouldn 't be ordering by the dynamic text group

within the config I would think would be your easiest bet.

____

you should find the sorting section, with the section id 59 and change the
field id. Hopefully that fixes it but it’s not a nice error to have… dynamic
text group should be able to handle it

it shouldn’t allow sorting. If you need it to appear within the list view I
can probably disable sorting/ let you know how.

@jonmifsud thanks! i didn't need it to be listed in the list view. i should
have removed that in the first place. thank you kindly for your help
