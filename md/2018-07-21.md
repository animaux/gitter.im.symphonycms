I am on symphony 2.7.7 with association field 2.0.2 and association output
1.0.1. When i attempt to 'include associations' within a data source attached
to a page (so i can pull in needed entry attributes) I get the following error
when i access the page: Symphony Fatal Error: Call to a member function
getIterator() on string. An error occurred in
/home/ashrimplin/[dev.shrimp.dj/extensions/association](http://dev.shrimp.dj/extensions/association)_output/extension.driver.php
around line 421. Example at <http://dev.shrimp.dj/mix/tomb-podcast-vol-14/>
Anyone had this problem?

@ashrimplin any reason why you are not usung the current `association_output
1.2.0`?
