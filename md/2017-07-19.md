I'm thinking of writing a Media Library extension, where it lists directories
and files within the Uploads folder. I find asset management one of the few
things letting Symphony down. I hope to use JIT with it, so you can select an
image and a recipe and it will provide a URL for the image. Would others find
this useful?

There was an extension which kind-of did this. But it exploded once there
where too many uploads… I’ve swayed to use an images section with assiciation
field and search since then

____

I handle embedding in text using a markdown editor with selection from this
association field. ( can do with more tweaks but does the trick at least for
now )

Yea that's what I tend to do too. I think a media library would be more
elegant and client friendly.

____

Also I find with the multi upload field, it 's easy to upload heaps of files
which don't get saved (e,g client refreshes after drag/drop instead of saving)
and they create bloat in the Uploads folder

____

  * saved to the entry, but uploaded to the folder

ah I handle uploads through S3 nowadays so don’t particularly use multi-upload
and the uploads folder anymore

hmm true I had toyed with the idea of S3, but it's not free right? First year
is or something but then it costs?

Ha just looked at the pricing. $0.025 per GB per month. That's pretty cheap.
