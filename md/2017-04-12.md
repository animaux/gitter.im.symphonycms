Is anyone else getting an error when creating a new section containing
location field? (2.6.11)

____

For me script execution times out after 30 seconds and I get an error saying
that something is wrong in `symphony\lib\toolkit\class.gateway.php` around
line `385`

____

not sure if this is symphony error or just location field bug

@andrewminton could you point me to the discussion you mention? (reg. multi-
section import)

____

@reygoch I suspect theres some geocoding going on without a google api key.
Thats what the map location field choked on before I updated it.

Correct, multi-section import you mentioned at begging of 2016 on here.

@animaux I've entered api key but something is amis :D, I've tried other
location field and that one works fine, but I couldn't find where is the bug
with this one.

I have a programming question for @nitriques: Let's say a class uses a private
variable which is defined as an empty array. Would you still make functions
inside this class use `empty` checks on that variable? AFAIK using `empty()`
only makes sense if a variable is not defined at all. So would you say "empty
is safer, maybe the variable has been unset somewhere"? Or would you say
"using empty is bad style" in this case?

@michael-e empty checks for multiple things: false, 0, '', [], array() are all
empty

____

From the Docs:

> No warning is generated if the variable does not exist. That means empty()
is essentially the concise equivalent to !isset($var) || $var == false.

@michael-e / @nitriques \- any one of you knows if we can create a member
without password and trigger the reset password? Kind of invite a user to
setup their password

@jonmifsud No, sorry, I have never tried that, nor am I aware of a solution
for this.

@nitriques I am afraid that my question wasn't clear. I know that using
empty() makes sense if you don't know if a variable has been set at all. But
this also means that it encourages sloppy programming. In the class I am
talking about the variable is defined as an array. So I personally would
prefer to use `if ($var)` instead of `if (!empty($var))`.
