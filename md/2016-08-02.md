@azzagazz start with the installation script :D

____

but why do you need that?

____

@all does anyone have any experience with building large portals on symphony
and how is the performance?

____

I 'm probably going to have a contract for building one automotive magazine
website and am expecting about 10 ~ 20 k visitors per day, so I'm not sure if
I can do it with symphony or should I do everything from scratch?

@reygoch i want to be able to set up installations from a build process.
without having to go to the frontend. so i acn clone a boilerplate repo, run
the gulp tasks and have a clean symphony installation with my optimal
configuration and extensions. but might be that i am overcomplicating things
in my head, i tend to do that :smile:

@reygoch I have a client which has over 2 million pageviews per month on
Symphony. I think that makes upwards of 60k pageviews a day. if your
datasources are set properly it’s all good. but you might want to add some
caching for performance if possible.

@azzagazz I would start with this:

@azzagazz I would make a zip with your symphony files, than I'd export
database and make a script that creates DB on your server, unzips files into
desired directory, changes DB username and password in your symphony config
php and executes DB export that you have made previously.

____

@jonmifsud is that VPS or shared hosting?

@reygoch yeah, that is what i am doing right now. but it feels kinda dirty to
be tracking an installed version in a boilerplate repo ^^ but should make no
difference right

It's the same thing. Installer just dynamically generates config and sets
admin password from data that you have provided.

You can also find sql script in install directory :D
