Hi All,

This will be a long Question. I have an issue with upgrading Symphony 2.2.5 to
Symphony 2.7.x and given below is the steps that I followed to upgrade to the
latest version.

1 - Deleted any unused extensions  
2 - Upgraded the Symphony core to 2.7.x  
3 - Uninstalled "Static section" and installed "Limit section entries" instead
(to limit the number of entries per section to 1)  
4 - Migrated Subsection manager to Association field using this process -
<https://github.com/symphonists/association_field/issues/3#issuecomment-52018015>  
5 - Upgraded all the extensions

Now I can log into the backend of the system and It seems to be all the
backend functionality is working except a navigation group called "Pages".
Within that navigation group, all the sections are using Association
Field(Previously using Sub Section Manager). When I visit one of the sections
within that nav group I encounter following error.

Symphony Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach()  
An error occurred in
/var/www/dev.mysite/public_html/extensions/association_field/fields/field.association.php
around line 200

In the front end of the site, I can't see any stylings or content for the
pages(note: content for the pages are coming from the "Pages" navigation
group). Also please note that regarding migration of Subsection manager to
Association field, whenever creating table entries in sym_fields_association
for sub section manager, subsection_id of the sub section manager table mapped
into the related_field_id of the association field table. I'm not sure whether
this is correct. Can someone please help me with this. Thank you.

I think you might have some datasources/chaining which would need to updated.
but not quite sure whatâ€™s wrong on that line 200. would need the instance to
look at it probably

Hi @jonmifsud. Thank you very much for your prompt reply. Actually the error
is coming from Association field plugin.

Hi All,  
Can anyone please advice me regarding migration of Subsection manager to
Association field, whenever creating table entries in sym_fields_association
for sub section manager, subsection_id of the sub section manager table mapped
into the related_field_id of the association field table or not ?.
