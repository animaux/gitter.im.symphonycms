Snipcart looks nice. I like this re. DOM hacking: "When defining your product
properties, within the HTML markup, you need to specify the data-item-url
property, which needs to be a URL where we can find your product metadata.
Before processing the payment, we will crawl the specified webpage, find the
matching product and make sure no properties have been altered by anyone. Of
course, the information submitted will need to match the one present during
our back-end validation. This way, we make sure that if someone edits your DOM
with any inspection tools such as the Chrome developer tools, they will not be
able to go through with the order." \- <http://docs.snipcart.com/getting-
started/security>

Another couple of cart/eCommerce jobbies: <http://www.foxycart.com/> (has been
discussed in more than one thread at the Symphony forum) and

@moretaste, I don't think the browser needs to properly support data
attributes for Snipcart to work. I imagine its JS gets the attribute values in
a way old browsers don't choke on.

@DavidOliver thanks for those pointers - @moretaste the _not supported_
features are not the standard data attributes but some set functions - from
what I can see it states partial support. In any case getting the attribute
value would work so I’d assume they’d have taken care of that in either case.

Ok, thanks. Always thought data attributes were not fully supported. Data
attributes get even more amazing now. :D

I’ve been using them for quite a while now - if you had something like jQuery
or another javascript library to handle that (assuming they support the
browsers you want) you should be ok. If you’re going vanilla it might take a
bit of extra coding.

high profile? in terms of popularity I guess right?

____

or is there any particular volume of traffic you’d consider ‘high profile’?

____

I def recall BBC WorldWide using symphony (though that was the old 3.0 which
was ‘dropped’)

@jonmifsud do you have the url for this site ?

____

high profile means  "big client" or "famous client"

____
