@cremol may I ask why is there a need for registration , when creating a
banner?  
also, could u maybe add google+ registration?

But all in all, amazing project, really. :) :+1:

Can someone remind me... taking in account current Symphony DB structure,
formally we would call it "extremely normalized", right? I can't remember
right terminology for this type of database.

@diomed Registration is so you can manage your banners in a secure
environment, it's like a CMS for banner creation. There's also a commercial
section where you can buy credits. They are like building blocks for your
banner. You wan't to keep that private as well. I tried to keep the Barrier as
low as possible. The only personal detail required is your email address to
verify the sign-up.

To make the barrier even lower i added the facebook log-in, which was a bit of
a headache really. So no google+ login yet for technical reasons. But maybe i
will add that in the future. Glad you liked it!
