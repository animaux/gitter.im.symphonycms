Hi guys, I'm fairly ok with the programming side of web dev but not very good
at the gui side, are there good templating systems that work well with
symphony? I've been using bootstrap but it's a bit boring and I'm not very
imaginative how to use it.

@peterfleck_twitter try semantic ui, very nice gui framework. Better and more
thoughtout than bootstrap in my opinion. And frankly, anything works with
symphony.
