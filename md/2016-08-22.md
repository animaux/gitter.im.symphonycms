Yup. I wonder. Is it intentional that the multiple dates are not sortable and
not by default sorted by their own value?

Apart from this there still is the problem I mentioned a few days ago. When
sorting by date, each entry is repeated correctly for each month it appears
in, which is nice. But inside each entry there’s no simple way to tell which
date is the one that triggered the specific repetition.

it’s a tricky one… how would you sort multiple dates? I’d be tempted to go by
the first available date and not care much about the multiples… (by default)
maybe it needs another mode which allows the same entry to appear multiple
times?

____

ah the 2nd one is easlier to solve with some PHP I would think

They do appear multiple times, which is perfect.

____

It’s just the sorting that get’s borked. F. E. months in wrong order.

____

Which is easy to fix in XSL.

____

But then mixed with other dates it get’s messy.

____

Regarding the date responsible for the current iteration of the entry in the
DS  @nilshoerrmann came to the same conclusion as we (above in this thread)
already in 2011:
<https://github.com/DeuxHuitHuit/datetime/issues/84#issuecomment-2346590>

I tried to understand the logic behind the Fields XML creation but my PHP and
Symphony internal skills suck.

It would solve half of my problem I think :)

____

Another way to work around this would be to remove the DS-Date-Grouping and do
all the grouping in XSL, but that’s quite an effort in XSLT1.

The other half would be the default sorting of multiple dates inside the D &T
field

There is a timeline-attribute in the XML output, but that makes no sense to
me.

Another way would be to only output the current `date` when the DS output is

Just for the records: the `timeline` attribute was introduced to allow easy
sorting by date. At the time this extension was created, the `timestamp`
attribute – which allows sorting by time as well – did not exist. So the
`timeline` attribute is a bit redundant today.

____

I think there should be three output modes: add dates, upcoming dates, passed
dates.

____

And there should be some kind of `status` attribute that indicated wheather a
date has already passed or is upcoming.

When you have a set of reoccurring dates and group output by date then the
entries inside a month are sorted by the earliest dates, even if they are not
in the current output month.

____

:worried:

____

If there _was_ an attribute marking the date responsible for the current
iteration, we could sort by that in the XSLT.

____

A whole world of workarounds

____

I’m starting to think removing the date-grouping and building the calendar
with XSLT might be the easier method. And all this only because using date  &
time with multiple dates made handling reoccurring dates much easier in the
backend. :/

> But sorting is not possible.

I have to admit that I haven’t used this field in a while, but if I remember
correctly, sorting of multiple dates on a single entry was always a manual
process (drag and drop – this is just a Duplicator interface). For automatic
sorting an extra settings that disables manual sorting would be a requirement.
So the current behaviour is correct: You haven’t sorted the latest entered
date to if cronological place, that’s why is stays last.

Currently, the extension expects you to use the `timeline` attribute in a
`xsl:sort` statement, if you need cronological order for an entry’s dates.

> I’ll try to sort the entries inside a month by the date matching the month
to fix this.

I have to admit that I’m not sure what you’d like to achieve here.

@nilshoerrmann I was grouping the output by the date field. But the order of
entries inside a month-node was not by the current date. So I was trying to
sort the entries by filtering the dates inside the current entry by the month-
node it was in. But that only works if there is only one repetition of the
entry inside a month. _nevermind_

Sorting should work: you should have an `orderable` class on your Date & Time
field. Anything in your console?
