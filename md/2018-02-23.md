Also @nitriques, years ago, I forked a WebHooks extension for Symphony, but my
extremely poor PHP abilities, wasn't able to get the interface to work

useful... here it is <https://github.com/bzerangue/webhooks/tree/patch-1>

@nitriques, please do. You could do more with it, than I could. Also, I cannot
take credit for that work, that is the genius of Wilhelm Murdoch,

Thanks, I know that would be extremely useful for the Symphony Community.
Thank you for all that you do!
