Apparently it's OK to store that data and also "essential" things like
shopping cart data to complete a transaction - in the EU law anyway. Sounds a
bit subjective.

Sorry to include myself into the "debate" but out of curiousity, is local
storage under the same restriction as cookies ?

and session storage ?

not sure I think you can argue it’s hazy especially since the server doesn’t
recieve information regarding local storage unlike cookies / normal sessions.

I was having a read yesterday and it looks like the "law" uses vague words
which you're meant to get an attorney to interpret. It looks like the law
wants to include anything that can be used for tracking, isn't local storage
limited by domain?

Yes but local storage doesn't do any tracking. Regards the bar as long as t&c
have the cookie stuff I think it covers. If you get a compliance request you
add it

A new Google requirement is coming on the 30th September for people who use
some of their products. I think it's to comply with changes to the Europe law
by the end of this year. You'll be supposed to declare the Google tracking
plus any other third-party from what I can tell.

The bigger companies in the sector have the compliance bar already so even
though it's a bit pointless it might give a more credible appearance to an
aspirational company.
