@nimanthaharshana modify the DS loop on the result using the `XMLElement`
properties and inject stuff as needed - done many times.

@nitriques or anyone else; did anyone play with DualAuthentication?

____

for Symphony Backend? I had an intern who was playing around with frontend and
should have the code lying somewhere working but exploring using Google
Authenticator for the backend

(to avoid rebuilding the interface for a prospect)

I’d suggest go confirm the spelling of Symphony. Symfony framework is more of
a backend engine. Symphony CMS is a whole CMS where you need to drop elements.
Likely if you know laravel the framework will be easier for you

No; ask if its Symphony CMS or Symfony Framework <https://symfony.com/> \- If
it’s the latter you’re in the wrong place… if the former we can maybe assist
by giving you some links.

@cyberlee1 its an objective question and one which I’d rather not debate. As I
said the CMS will not help you in your project at all. I suggest go ask in the
respective forums.
