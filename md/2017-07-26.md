Morning. Does anyone know where the documentation for the Frontend
Localisation extension is? There's nothing in the github wiki, nor
`README.md`. The site I've been upgrading uses `<xsl:value-of
select="key('translations','text-to-translate')"/>` in its XSL files, and I
need to work out where this comes from as the values are blank in the latest
version of the plugin (as opposed to the one they _were_ using from four years
ago). Anyone got any ideas?

____

I suspect it 's been changed to a different call or value in the latest
version, since `fl_translations` was completely removed at some point between
now and then.

@animaux Me when I have the time. Wanna help ?

____

@TwoWholeWorms You are right: the translation files are gone. Currently, the
extension only provides a data source and some php libs

____

I 've migrated a site recently and replaced the files with a section with a
key input field and a value multilingual textbox

Out of curiosity, what are the user stats on the forums? They don't seem to
see much action these days. Questions go un answered for a while. Have you
noticed a decline in Symphony usage?
