@munki-boy yup, pretty much. You could run curl or wget from a remote server
that you have access to.

__ __

<http://www.getsymphony.com/discuss/thread/44717/>

__ __

for example `curl --silent --compressed
http://test.com/symphony/extension/xmlimporter/importers/run/testimport/?auth-
token=123e45f6` or `wget -O - -q -t 1
http://test.com/symphony/extension/xmlimporter/importers/run/testimport/?auth-
token=123e45f6`

Aha, I was hitting a "secret" page with a event attached but @animaux way it's
all safely hidden.

__ __

If I wanted to do this casually from local WAMP to remote hosting would I need
to be aware of anything dangerous?

I’m not an expert. Not sure if someone could »steal« the auth-token?

@munki-boy, if your request is going over the Internet and the auth-token or
anything else in the URL or request should remain private you should use TLS
(https). Even if the auth-token is only to run the import, if that's
moderately intensive someone could repeatedly trigger it as part of a DoS
attack.

@DavidOliver So, even in @animaux example above
"...<http://test.com/symphony/>..." should be "[https://"](https://&quot); to
be safe?

Of course. Every sniffer in a network (may be: Internet) can see a URL that
you request, unless you request it using SSL/TLS. If you use SSL/TLS, the
encrypted connection to the host will be established **before** actually
requesting the complete URL.

__ __

So with SSL/TLS, a sniffer can only see that you connect to the host, but he
can not see the complete URL.

Often with shared hosting there is no good SSL/TLS or there is a strange URL
to use, so I don't know if it's a good solution for shared hosting after all.

Your shared hosting provider should be able to arrange an SSL certificate for
you. If they can't, you know they don't deserve your custom.

__ __

To clarify, I wasn't suggesting it should be available at no extra cost;
they'll probably charge for it. :)

It's a clients shared host and they don't get my custom, but sometimes we
don't get to choose the host. Shared hosts often supply a third-party
certificate and a site url might be something like
"<https://secure.whatever.com/www.theclientsite.com>". They charge under £200
GBP I would imagine but I haven't enquired about that for a couple of years.
Easier to get a cheap VPS IMO rather than try to SSL on a shared host.
