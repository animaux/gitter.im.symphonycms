I think it might be something wrong with this

             $div->appendChild(Widget::Input('fields'.$fieldnamePrefix.'[author_username]'.$fieldnamePostfix, $author_username, 'text', array('readonly' => 'readonly') ));
            $div->appendChild(Widget::Input('fields'.$fieldnamePrefix.'[author_id]'.$fieldnamePostfix, $author_id, 'text', array('readonly' => 'readonly') ));
            $wrapper->appendChild($div);

This part is in displayPublishPanel but when I submit the entry I can see
these vars as $_POST data but var_dump($data) is null. I'm confused about how
it works.

how does that render?

____

as in if you had to inspect the element within the backend - my guess is that
it’s not the same structure as the rest.

It's like two input boxes with my username and Id, I think the field name is
wrong. I'll go and inspect someone else' extension and see if I can find the
right syntax.

what I am referring to is the “name” value of the input fields. That is what
would put the data in the right place.

but it just gave both fields the same name which was the label, which looked

hmmm yeah true that would be wrong

____

the default is to have something like this : `fields[{fieldname}]`

____

so if you want an array it has to be :

    
    
       fields[ {fieldname}][author_username]

____

I am not sure what `$fieldnamePrefix` is putting in there - but I don’t think
it puts your field name. Basically you want to submit array-values for your
field. So you define first your field name, then the values you want another
level deep.

Great I'll give that a go, I think the $fieldnamePrefix stuff might be an old
way to do things. I'm learning from old extensions and bits from the forum.
AFAIK it's not doing anything because it's not populated anymore.

It said somewhere on getsymphony that it was used in older versions but I don
't know why either.

There aren’t many extensions which pass array values. Also the ones which pass
array values same thing would have the name in this format:

    
    
    fields[{fieldname}][]

Maybe I shouldn't be passing an array. I just wanted two values in a table
that adds backend author/creator to an entry the first time it's saved. Also,
learning how that stuff works.

Ahh, going for a sleep, I 'll have another go at this later, cheers for the
advice :)

____

I would just pass the author id - then you can generate the author name once
you are saving into the database (if you really want to) or when you’re
reading the data (which is more appropriate)

____

That sounds simpler, I can just display author name on the publish page to
show who the owner is. Night

Doesn’t look too erroneous? Extract the zip, run a command, recompile PHP with
saxon, done?

That would be interesting - though haven’t mad much things which XSLT 1 makes
it impossible to achieve. Though granted 2 might be a bit more efficient with
a few more native functions

Some clients are hosted on a shared host. That could give problems if the host
won't recompile php with saxon.

I read that grouping is easier, it has regular expressions and temporary
trees(/fragments?) can be accessed (I wanted to do this myself once and exslt
:node-set didn't seem to work iirc). But I haven't done any real XSLT for
ages, and I never was very good with it.

____

It sounds like there are other improvements too? Real functions?

Am I right in thinking that Java isn 't required to run Saxon/C?

Saxon/C from my understanding would just be run using C - so can be compiled
on a system level no java requirement

what do you mean?

If you have a datasource usually it has the ‘formatted’ and ‘unformatted’
option. Unformatted would be the markdown inserted in the backend usually.

to have a mark down editor in the front end. So visitors can style there
comments for example

markdown. You can do a ‘preview’ function I think if you want too

that was quite easy. I use the editor_for_symphony. Add scripts and css, add
class 'markdown' to textarea and done. I guess I was overthinking it. Time for
a beer :-)
