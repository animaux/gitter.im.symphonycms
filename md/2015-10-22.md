I've got a datasource with around 350-400 entries. The build time is around
.5s (so .5s to long :-)). How can I improve that? Or maybe does cachelite
helps?

____

I use the datasource to build a searchable selectbox

yes, I have a fork which can even use memcached if you like

____

the original one by Nick Dunn used file storage in the manifest/tmp folder

I have a version which relies on ‘symphony cache’ can be swapped between db
and other providers.

____

yep pretty much - not sure the fork name I have in production btu I can
confirm it

____

probably the last one which was updated.

____

it has some fancy functions which would clear the cache when an entry within
that section is saved (but might not always be desired)

suggest you try it out on a copy other than production. In case it messes
something up.

after install there is some minor configuration

____

namely editing the datasource to add how long the datasource should be cached
for. $dsParamCache

____

might not be so well documented, I don’t think that the variable has been
added in a UI in the latest version… if not I’ll need to do that at some point

____

as each ds would have a different cache time, some maybe not cached at all.
Configured properly it makes your site fly. only downside is if you have a lot
of entries and you have edits all the time - there you might need some
tweaking/adjusting so the cache is not cleared all the time.

open the datasource file in a text editor

____

where there are all the other params add something like :  
public $dsParamCache =  '60';

____

the value is in minutes so that would cache it for an hour

yeah exactly - I took a fork from someone else which had some work already -
and didn’t go back to adding the UI - used it on a couple of projects (hard-
coded most datasources) so ui was a bit of an overkill for internal use. I do
need to add it though

I can't mix this up in a datasource filter, i think `{$ds-src-cat.system-
id:0}, not:1528`

not that way

____

if you’re up to customizing it you can make it work though

____

wait you want to pick up the system id, excluding 1528? or fall back to not
1528 if none found?

easiest way (in my opinion) would be to modify the grab function, and if the
param contains 1528 you just remove it. you can’t use a not and normal filter
in one go. but that would make it non-editable from the DS editor

that client made 900+ pages in a day. Now waiting when he starts to complain
about a penalty in google for duplicate content
