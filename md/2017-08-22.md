@pixelninja @josealbertorodriguesjunior but if you use FB/Disqus or alike you
don’t have full control over your comments.

How do you mean? They have quite comprehensive admin settings and analytics.
Comments can be moderated, removed etc. it's just done through their own
interfaces rather than through Symphony.

I think what @animaux means is that its not stored on your datadabase - but at
times that makes more sense to split to give a third party access to
moderation without opening up symphony access.

themselves `:)`

pros & cons for everything :)

most of the time I prefer self-hosted data too but depending on the usecase
some options might make more sense if client is happy with the data tradeoff

yep I don’t want to host those nor images on the actual servers. I prefer to
offload them to S3 or something similar, and for videos would be a video
hosting service

Urghs, I’d never use S3 or similar. Video hosting services are fine though
