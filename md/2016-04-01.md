@johnpuddephatt thanks for the heads up thought it was something of the like.
I think there where still some things which where not quite 100% with the link
structure so might have to evaluate if we can get it to do exactly what we
want.

@nitriques / @michael-e did any of you ever play with sending `304` headers in
Symphony?

No. Wouldn't it be against the idea of delivering "fresh" content? What
exactly do you think of?

not necessarily

____

I’ve been asked if I could generate them for caching purposes to reduce load
on a server.

____

I’m thinking things like ‘single-entry’ based pages in particular would
benefit if Symphony is able to 1. set the correct last modified header and 2.
return a 304

____

Obviously that would be via an extension rather than the core; as the core
wouldn’t know anything about your `content` structure. Was wondering if anyone
played with the concept before.

I mean "Symphony's idea". Which doesn't mean that I don't use frontend
caching, for example. I worked with Varnish and nginx to achieve this. I purge
the frontend cache when entries are saved.  
Your 304 idea is interesting, but it won't be that simple, probabyly, because
ideally you would have to check which content is used on a particular page.

We do have Varnish and Nginx on this particular site; but I think they’re
possibly ill-configured by the Sys-admins (at least that’s what one them was
saying). I don’t think it’s necessarily that complex; however in all likely-
hood you will need either a) custom mapping to determine the page entry or b)
run the actual datasource - which well partly defeats the whole purpose of
doing it

That's the point. Running all datasources is most of the load.

____

Do you have numbers? Is it that much traffic (pages built in parallel), or is
it just that the whole baby is too slow in building a single page?

I’ll poke around and keep you posted. Seems like it’s an item which is coming
up within the next month or so; with this client. If I manage to make it site-
agnostic.

I don’t think it’s that slow; it’s more that one of the sys-admins is trying
to say that Varnish is not doing anything useful for this site (or at least it
was I seeminly disabled a couple of datasource caches during my last update…)

Locally with all datasources cached I get a generation time of approx .6s
that’s using a VM and the homepage; the thing is that an internal un-cached
page currently takes around 2s.

____

if varnish could communicate with symphony using a 304 header (assuming cache
expired) I guess that would mean that varnish could serve it’s previous
version (though I might be totally wrong)

Varnish could probably do that.

____

Well, 2 seconds is pretty slow. Even in my  "big system", with all caches
disabled and/or useless, the most complex pages take less than that.

____

Is that page so heavy, data-wise?

____

Or do you include a lot of data which you don 't need in the end?

there’s a `lot` of stuff going on.

____

partially there were some recent changes and I didn’t have the time to
optimize for performance after making the changes.

____

usually I kill datasources which are not required at the grab/execute
function.

Solution 1: nginx or Varnish cache. Drop the cache completely when entries are
saved.

____

Solution 2: 304 logic in Symphony. Make Varnish only drop the cache when the
response is not 304.

____

What 's the difference?

good point we already have solution 1 in place.

____

on a per-url basis

____

yeah I think it’s all because of a Varnish misconfiguration

____

or to explore it’s use/preformance benefits I guess

thanks for the tips I’ll be checking in to see what is actually happening with
Varnish because if it’s not working properly we should be configuring it right
at least. Probably that loads up the database which then impacts speed on
queries too.

Cachelite does sends 304:

ah never mind that last comment the 2seconds is on the profile page. Through
an incognitio window (not logged in I do get a varnish 304) need to see what
the sys-admin is after exactly...
