Should I send PRs to the `integration` branch generally? Or simply master?

Hey guys I'm looking for a formbuilder (doesn't have to be symphony related).
Any recommendations?

We had such a request as well. I was happy to source out the dev of that site

Don’t think there is anything around to do this in Symphony.

An external service is ok for this. I've tried <https://www.typeform.com/> but
I m curious if somebody has experience with similar services

can someone please tell me how to clear the cache in symphony, when I edit my
twig files, they always stay the same

____

ive got over 14 hours trying to solve this problem

____

how can i know what cache is even running

____

phpinfo says opcache is running but composer.json lists doctrine-cache-bundle
so how do I even know which one is running

____

i tried opcache_reset() and got an undefined function

____

how can I just force twig to display the new file

A client ask if suppliers can place news on their website without having
access to the back-end. Can I use the member extension for that?

Ok time to give members a try.

@hernandocounty do you mean symphony or the php framework symfony (with a F)?
