@michael-e Is this a response from the mailserver?

Nevermind. Think I know now what the problem is. `;)`

Yes, it's the remote server's response. `User unknown` is pretty clear, isn't
it? :-)

It is. However this setup is a bit tricky. The user exists, but the mail is
sent from a different smtp-server than the user exits on.

I don't understand. Do you mean **to** a different SMTP server?

Our client has it’s own mail server, which is properly set up in the providers
DNS settings. However I created a user on the providers own mailserver to send
mail. That worked as long as I sent mails to other domains. When trying to
send a mail to a user on the same domain, the server probably only checked
it’s own users. At least that’s my theory. And it belongs to me.

So your email is considered "internal" by the mail server that is supposed to
deliver it?

That’s what I suspect.

____

Now I just need to wait for an account on their »proper« server.

Could it be that the HELO-hostname will not work in this case?

____

I get a:

    
    
        Symphony Warning:  stream_socket_enable_crypto(): Peer certificate CN=`*.kasserver.com' did not match expected CN=`ejbweimar.de'

____

Not sure where he gets the `kasserver.com` from.

____

I probably have the wrong address for the server.

TLS fails. You need the correct hostname that works with TLS.

Thanks. Haven’t got that from the clients service provider … I hate to be
dependant.
