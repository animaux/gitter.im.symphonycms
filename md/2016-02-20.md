Is it possible to make a regular DS in symphony and then edit it to just
return DISTINCT values like Nils does here

but then it won’t be a ‘regular’ DS anymore :)

What I'm actually trying to do is get just distinct tags from all used tags
but I want to chain another DS off it and I'm not sure if it's best to go full
custom like Nils or mod the DS formerly known as 'regular' :)

what he does is a manual query and outputs the results. but you can create a
DS then change the ‘execute’ function to do what you want

____

re chaining not a problem as long as you update the `param_pool`

Well I have this execute function by default

____

    
    
         public function execute(array &$param_pool = null)
    {
        $result = new XMLElement($this->dsParamROOTELEMENT);
        try{
            $result = parent::execute($param_pool);
        } catch (FrontendPageNotFoundException $e) {
            // Work around. This ensures the 404 page is displayed and
            // is not picked up by the default catch() statement below
            FrontendPageNotFoundExceptionHandler::render($e);
        } catch (Exception $e) {
            $result->appendChild(new XMLElement('error', $e->getMessage() . ' on ' . $e->getLine() . ' of file ' . $e->getFile()));
            return $result;
        }
        if ($this->_force_empty_result) {
            $result = $this->emptyXMLSet();
        }
        if ($this->_negate_result) {
            $result = $this->negateXMLSet();
        }
        return $result;
    }

I think if you want what nils did just copy his function instead of yours

____

then what you need to do in `foreach($tags as $tag){` add the following

    $param_pool[$this->dsParamROOTELEMENT . ‘.tag’][] = $tag['handle’];

____

I think that should do the trick for the param pool

____

but chaining off it when you are selecting ‘all’ tags seems a bit ‘redundant /
inefficient '

hmm but the entry id’s I don’t know if they are of any use when you’re doing
distinct

Oh yes just noticed that, it has fetched all the tags I think.

____

Or rather in Nils ' where it made each distinct tag a node and had a number
for how many times the tag actually was used, this new way has separated them
all out and grouped by @id.

@munki-boy grouping by entry id is pointless unless your tag is used just once

Yes, I see that now. How about the entry id of only the first occurrence?

but you don’t know what is the first occurance

____

mysql doesn’t let you choose which id is pulled up

____

so it’s somewhat ‘random’ and/or not controlled so you can’t really rely on it

It can still work for me in this case, the pulled up id can be random as long
as it does have the appropriate tag. I can do it from here in xslt, but it
would be more efficient to do stuff in the DS instead as there may be many
tags.

Thanks @jonmifsud I've got my head round it a bit now, the 'regular' DS
doesn't have the SQL query stuff in because that's kept in the core?

Ah, you were right @jonmifsud I filtered myself right back to inefficiency, I
can make a custom DS from the other section rather than chain it. Learning
everyday :)

Trying to put my IDs in the param pool from my custom DS but it is in the form
of a comma separated list and I can't seem to filter with it. I think I need
each ID to have <item> around it. I have this line that @jonmifsud showed me
earlier

____

    
    
                     $param_pool[$this->dsParamROOTELEMENT . ‘.ids’][] = $tag['entry_id'];

____

Could anyone help with the syntax to add the  <item>...</item>

____

Also do things to filter from the param pool need to have  "ds-" prefix or
just convention?

It had some of these "`" instead of those "'", so the param name wasn't what I
expected it to be. Somehow this made a comma separated list but now I
corrected the typos, it makes some XML nodes as I wanted. :thought_balloon:
