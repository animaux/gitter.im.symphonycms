This is funny how I've been toying around with some ideas and also ended up on
the functional programming language path, exploring Racket atm. :D

There is one thing I'm not so convinced about, it is that non-XSLT solutions
encapsulate HTML with some notation, whereas XSTL preserves most of it. The
problem with all non-XSLT solutions I've seen is that you have to learn two
dialects, one to write and another to read, whereas with XSLT if you can write
you can pretty much read too.

But I'm not also convinced the people that can't learn a dialect are the
people I want to write frontend code. :-)

+1 on that last statement :) If someone is really unable to learn something
you’re going to be asking questions

> symphony database class separately

@mojighahar what do you mean exactly, you want to use the Symphony MySQL Class
outside of the Symphony context or you want to manipulate the data by using
the database class directly?

If I recall correctly all you need is to include `bootstrap.php` that will
initialise the Symphony environment and give you access to `Symphony::` etc
via the autoloader

I think there are quite a few dependencies.. since you would have quite a few
dependencies

I used to use the below for a while but that was before we had the Auto
Loader. I used to use quite a few of these… so maybe not all are required.

    
    
    //include som symphony files and utilities to have same Symphony Interface
    require_once (dirname(__FILE__) . '/../../symphony/lib/boot/func.utilities.php');
    // require_once ('symphony/lib/boot/func.utilities.php');
    
    //define some basic Symphony Values used by Symphony Functions
    define_safe('ROOT',dirname(__FILE__) . '/../..');
    define_safe('CORE', ROOT . '/symphony/lib/core');
    define_safe('TOOLKIT', ROOT . '/symphony/lib/toolkit');
    define_safe('FACE', ROOT . '/symphony/lib/interface');
    define_safe('MANIFEST', ROOT . '/manifest');
    define_safe('EMAILGATEWAYS', TOOLKIT . '/email-gateways');
    define_safe('CONFIG', MANIFEST . '/config.php');
    define_safe('TOOLSLOG', MANIFEST . '/logs/tools');
    
    include (CORE . '/class.log.php');
    include (CORE . '/class.errorhandler.php');
    
    //use the same XML & MySQL toolkits as Symphony CMS this eneables greater flexibility an coherance
    include (TOOLKIT. '/class.mysql.php');
    include (TOOLKIT. '/class.xmlelement.php');
    include (TOOLKIT. '/class.email.php');
    //create a global database object so all functions can reference the same initialized Database
    global $Database;
    global $settings;

No problem; Symphony is pretty lean in-general so the whole context will not
slow you down unlike other CMS's

I had used it in the past; but serves a different purpose to how I use
symphony. I had also ‘missed’ the power of XSLT templates with Laravel and I
didn’t have much time to try plug in an XSLT Processor at the time.
