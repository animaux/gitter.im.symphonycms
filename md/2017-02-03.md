Is there somewhere a limit of 200? When I do the export after 200 entries I've
got an error: `Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by
(output started at
.../public/extensions/importcsv/content/content.index.php:439)`

This is what it further on said in the error:

    
    
    An error occurred in .../public/symphony/lib/boot/func.utilities.php around line 153
    
    148 if ((stripos($hdr, 'Set-Cookie') !== false) &
    149 $custom_cookies[] = $hdr
    150 }
    151 }
    152
    153 header_remove('Set-Cookie')
    154
    155 foreach ($custom_cookies as $custom_cookie) {
    156 header($custom_cookie)
    157 }

____

I think the `function cleanup_session_cookies()`

This is still the case I think:
<http://www.getsymphony.com/discuss/thread/457/> ? Tried already a generic
xslt template to convert to csv.

____

Ok I can export a section with 3000 entries so it is something specific with
this section

____

another section*

It was something with an association field that throws an error.

Client: can you send me a csv file of all product entries. Sure that is a
matter of a minute or so ... 1.5 day later :worried:

____

Guess it is an error in my filter

Only one association field gives an error: `Table
'qpall.sym_entries_data_238,35' doesn't exist`. 35 is the section id.

I don't understand why or where the `,35` is added.
