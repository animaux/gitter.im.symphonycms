Could it be possible to filter entries shown by the association field? For
example show only the entries where field x contains y.

____

Mmm ... The Reflection Field supports some advanced filtering syntax prefixes
like regexp: and not-contains: which might work (although right now I don 't
see support for not-regexp: in the code). Lets try that

I don’t think association would support contains, reflection might do the
trick, otherwise maybe you can try chaining

reflection can do filtering throug xslt but when I return those values back in
an association the empty values returns as id

I have one section for articles (title, body, image, etc) with a selectbox
that contains the languages. Inside this section I want to give the option to
choose the original article in the main language. So that field should only
contains the articles in the main language.

yeah it wouldn’t involve core changes. I was doing something somewhat similar,
as in I need to ‘differenciate’ my options for a client. Eg difference between
a blog/article section (idea is to add a class and add a border color) working
in that way seems least intrusive

yep that’s it

____

but you might note that the ‘filters’ are set within the core interface. I
think that might have been the reason I needed the core - and because the
association table is defined within the core as well.

so the Association Field, if not mistaken (it’s been a while since I edited
the code) uses a ‘core’ function to display the association options. The only
variables which it provides are the kind of UI you want to plug in. To be able
to add ‘filters’ the same UI had to be modified. let me see if I can get you a
screenshot of what I mean might be better to explain.

____

The core change adds the Association Filters component

____

I’m not exactly sure how ‘urgent’ the setup is for you but I can def look if
it can work without this component. Have got another extension, which changes
filters via JS maybe that in addition to the Association UI update might be
sufficient will need to check though

ah wait

____

I think you want to look at association_ui_edito/content

____

the content.get.php and possibly the content.query.php

____

_if_ you want you could probably copy the modifications I had in the _get_
function

____

as it does some filtering and you could set the Id’s / filters manually.

I would guess that’s why the client wanted a distinction because if they’re in
doubt they would refer to the color to make sure it’s properly attributed.
(though they only have a handful of blogs they use)

and I would guess if you had to use something like that you’d want full

trying to think how I could package it, I’m in between two options. a) the
thing would just add a ‘class’ and you’d have to define a css file from the
workspace (guidance provided)  
b) pulls a list of values, and allows you to set colors from a predefined
list.

yeah I could generate the CSS file for that matter. I’d lean more towards a)
because it’s less work to package. I’ll give it some more work as needs some
changes in the association_ui_selector and I’ll see if I can package it in a
decent way.
