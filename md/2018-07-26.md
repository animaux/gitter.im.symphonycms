Hi guys, I wrote here couple of weeks ago about having trouble to get just any
values from ML fields, even from new clean plain Symphony installs. Well,
everything works fine, just wanted to let you know. Which I knew it should,
but I overlooked one thing on my side and failed to notice a few times. Thanks
very much for helping me out!
