I can't seem to xpath this youtube feed I have in remote DS, I can't get
further down than the youtube-feed node and its attributes.

____

    
    
     <youtube-feed status="fresh" cache-id="421efaddb80429001d57424a02a4600a" creation="2015-09-03T00:57:42+01:00" url="https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC-xS1cf8mXEwidiYzX7TJVw">
    
        <feed xmlns:yt="http://www.youtube.com/xml/schemas/2015" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">
    
     <link rel="self" href="http://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC-xS1cf8mXEwidiYzX7TJVw"/>
    
     <id>yt:channel:UC-xS1cf8mXEwidiYzX7TJVw</id>
    
     <yt:channelId>UC-xS1cf8mXEwidiYzX7TJVw</yt:channelId>

____

I tried stuff like [youtube-feed/@status](mailto:youtube-feed/@status) and
that works but something like youtube-feed/feed/id doesn't seem to work.

____

Could someone write the example path and I 'll figure out the rest of the
nodes.

@munki-boy I think you may need to specify the namespace of the `feed`
element.

The remote DS automatically added the namespaces for "yt" and "media", I've
now added "feed" and "<http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom>" as a third namespace but
I still can't seem to access the feed node or deeper by typing "youtube-
feed/feed/id" into the debug command line for example.
