Still I don't like the idea, because it creates a strange dependency, and it
won't work with a generic 404 page (because it has no XML, AFAIK). Is it just
me?

ah I’m not interested to get the output out to the frontend. Logging would
work just fine. It’s just that using ?debug on a 404 error seems useless.

Maybe an alternative would be to ‘not trigger the 404' when using `?debug`

odd; you must have enabled something else; like an additional encoding on the

ah yes you def need a markdown text formatter; the formatter does not have a
UI but it will translate your text into valid html; without markdown all
content is encoded

____

imp after adding the extension; and setting the field to Markdown (ideally
extra + smarty pants gives best results in my opinion) you will have to re-
save your entry data for it to be processed as HTML not encoded text

exactly what jon said ;)

____

you need to resave all entries

____

But it should return the data as cdata is the encoded option is not set

Without a formatted symphony encodes. As invalid xHTML would throw errors

eg `<br>` works in html it will save in your editor. The markdown formatter
will either note it as invalid; or will fix it. The standard version just
encodes it and serves it as-is
