I'm currently rebasing `integration` against `2.7.x` @nitriques

____

Been a while since we have synced them and I 'm keen to keep going with
installer stuff so thought it's best to go from a common base

Ah it seems a '<' isnt allowed in a password and all characters after that are
stripped

I 'm not super familiar with the emailing code, @creativedutchmen and
@michael-e are though :)

Are you sending emails using the `Email::create`?

Looking at the error message it seems that you use the Email Template Manager,
right? I am not aware of any character stripping. Please test systematically
using different Gmail passwords, starting with pure alpha-numeric password.

before it gets to the config

Good idea, @brendo. So one might check the config file first!

____

(Since the ETM is using the default email credentials, saved in the config
file.)

So basically at the moment you're unable to send an email via Symphony, and
the theory is that isn't something to do with the password not being sent
correctly?

or through mail.php

the affected server doesn 't work with the script, other server does so it

Yep, maybe you can't connect through the firewall. But in this case I wonder
where Symphony's error message comes from. `Incorrect authentication data` is
not a Symphony error message at all.

Hmm, yeah wonder if there's something else at play

____

So the last couple of days I 've been sick so had a bit of time to play around
with Symphony

____

It 's really interesting looking at how other frameworks structure the
projects these days for distribution

____

As I add more things into Symphony, I realise it 's become a little messy for
an application developer

____

With our build scripts and what not

____

We just have everything as  'Symphony', you download that and then remove the
things you don't need and off you go

____

Whereas something like Laravel is structured like:

  1. `illuminate/*` for each of the components that make up Laravel
  2. `laravel/framework` the full framework, each of the components is sub-tree split into the above, this is where the tests live
  3. `laravel/laravel` is the application a user downloads which pulls in the framework as a dependency. Ultimately this is _super_ clean because all the application files will be  'yours'

[Jun 28 2016

Symfony is a little different:

  1. `symfony/*` for each of the packages, including their tests
  2. `symfony/symfony` is the full framework, where the components are also sub-tree split
  3. Projects either reference `symfony/symfony` through composer, or they encourage downloading the 'official' Symfony installer to get your project started

____

Something like Slim, is well, Slim, so it includes all of it 's dependencies
in it's own repo. Little different as it doesn't provide a UI

I'm thinking it would be a good idea to break Symphony apart like the other
frameworks to allow us to keep the application clean from
distribution/build/test logic, and give us the freedom to do build/test logic
in the components

____

Hell we may even find that some of the components we are using can be
outsourced

____

It 's kinda funny in retrospect

____

When I originally worked with Symphony I loved that the whole codebase was
less than a MB

____

Now that I 've worked with it for several years, and worked on other projects
with 90%+ test coverage, I really wish we had that level of reliability and
stability built in and am happy to sacrifice file size for it

____

I can embrace the concept as minimal, even if it 's implemented with a heavier
footprint

Thanks @brendo for the rebase!

____

My goal was to create sym-core, sym-admin-ui, sym-datasources, sym-xsl-
frontend and so on

____

each package should follow the unix principle, i.e. ~~do~~ _be responsible
for_ one thing and do it well

+1 from me. It feels like the right way to go. Someone could then build their
own admin UI if they wanted to introduce a different flavour.

____

Without effecting other components that have a solid codebase to work from.

it 's harder to work with the current code base, but easier to build upon it
afterwards
