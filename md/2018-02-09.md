Is there any alternative to the extension 'Author Roles' as it is quite old
and looks like its no longer maintained for newer symphony versions?

Basically the same as the 'Author Roles' extension with the different
permissions on users but the extension is no longer maintained and is old and
no longer works correctly on symphony 2.7 versions. I remember seeing in here
that there was a newer extension that does the same things but cant remember
the name of it.

the members extension is for frontend logins, the Author Roles extension is
for Authors in the backend

@Huttch I'm using [Group Lock](https://github.com/mazedigital/group_lock) in a
project to segment Symphony Authors and give permissions to Sections. (Sym
2.6.11) Seems to work quite well for my needs.

Hi guys. I haven't made an extension before but want to include this api -
<https://developers.lulu.com/documentation> What would be your advice and
pitfalls to avoid? I was thinking of looking at the paypal extension as a
possible starting place?

Or maybe I can use this directly -
<http://symphonyextensions.com/extensions/rest_api/> ?
