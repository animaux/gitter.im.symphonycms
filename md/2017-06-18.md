Hi everybody, we have a release candidate (Symphony 2.7.0RC1), so please test
and break it—then we get another one for free!

@jonmifsud I would convert to a number field, if I recall correctly, it uses
int(11) , but make sure it is what I say! ´cause messing up with the core
field (or any field imho) might crash future updates...

@iotsci are you getting the error when you load the installer or when you
click install ?

____

Is it a wamp/mamp setup or a linux box? Which version of apache?
