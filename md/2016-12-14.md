@jonmifsud I have found a very strange bug in the AI Selector Search
Interface. Will post an issue and would be happy if you could take a look
since this is bugging a client seriously …

It’s probably because of Umlauts :)

Oops. There is already a bug … mazedigital/association_ui_selector#55 will
post more details there.

@animaux I guess you still haven’t figured this out right?

N’ah it’s off my skills … tried everything. I have systems that work and that
don’t. Setup is exactly the same in every way.

would it be possible to get a copy of one of the systems with the issue? Since
it’s hard to replicate might be easier to follow through one which has the
bug.

Ok, I have a quite heavily molested local copy of a site :)

Hang on a second.
