The :baby: is a lot harder to program than the usual symphony hack `:D`

I didn’t know it was programmable… I was pretty sure it has some kind of AI,
self-learning stuff

It’s an analogue interface that requires a lot of very repetative cryptic
assembly commands.

@animaux What about Gitter's own auto-archive?
<https://gitter.im/symphonycms/symphony-2/archives/> Admittedly, it's very
hard to find. I only found it through Google with `search term
site:gitter.im`. Basically `/archives/` on the end of a Gitter URL.

It’s there and you can use it. But

  1. it’s very hard to find anything in there 
  2. search on this site sucks
  3. gitter or the archive could be gone tomorrow …

I’ve simply copied the html from the overview, extracted all hrefs and curled
them with a shellscript. Afterwards I converted the rather ugly html to md via
`html2text.py`.
