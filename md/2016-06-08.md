Mode 2 looks good so far. Nice @nitriques !

Is JIT still using GD?

I've just successfully installed Symphony from the 2.7.x branch to test it in
the Hiawatha webserver, and am now getting a prompt in the admin area to
update to '2.7.0.beta1'. Is that expected and okay to proceed with?

__ __

Also, what's the best way to find out which versions of the "main" extensions
are planned to form the bundle version of 2.7 so that I can install some of
them for testing?

~~`beta1` sounds wrong. The current `2.7.x`-version should be the
`master`-branch, I think.~~

__ __

Ah, d’oh. sorry

__ __

was thinking `2.6.x`

I think the same ones from 2.6.x would be part of the bundle

@jonmifsud yeah? This is with the exception of JIT I guess?

ah maybe the versions would update - so I’d think there would be JIT 2.x
(whatever is on the relevant master branch at time of release)

I don’t expect new extensions to be added to the bundle that’s for sure

Yes, I mean the versions to test rather than which extensions.

I just ran the '2.7.0.beta1' update Symphony was telling me about from the
admin area, which reported success, but then instead of the admin page I got
'Request was rejected for having an invalid cross-site request forgery token.'

__ __

Re-accessing the page (not refreshing so as not to resend POST) allows access
to the admin area.

`'enable_xsrf' => 'no',` could help?

I do have access now. It's just the initial admin page load after the 'beta'
update that wanted to be run after the 2.7.x branch install. Is it usual
there's an update to run after installing from this branch?

yes I think that’s normal. not sure why you got the error though. I don’t
recall having the same issue when I upgraded one recently

Shouldn't `extensions/` be in .gitignore?

not sure I don’t think it ever was

__ __

because you’ll want to track whatever extensions you have set up.

__ __

though if you add as submodules it will be just the reference not file
contents

I see that JIT's rewrite rule is now rewriting to `/index.php` rather than
`/extensions/jit_image_manipulation/lib/image.php`, and "JIT image process is
it's own Symphony renderer now", so I've updated my non-Apache webserver's
rewrite rule to match and it seems to be working. Just out of curiosity,
what's the benefit to this?

I would think (but @nitriques should correct me) one of the reasons would be
for increased flexibility. So extensions can set up their own JIT modes
without having to touch the JIT extension. but I haven’t tried it out yet.

Cool, thanks. This might include fields needing thumbnails, without having to
rely on dynamic recipes being allowed?
