@jonmifsud Hey

____

@jonmifsud Would welcome any migration tips here. We ideally wont to import
the members tables as is without interfering with the login credentials at
all. I guess export DB tables would be the easiest approach here? or have you
imported using a custom DS/Event?

on cacheable ds.

@jonmifsud any chance you could have a look at it. It’s not pressing though

@andrewminton what you say should be do-able via database if not mistaken
there is some possible configuration stuff relating to the salt/hash used
ideally the same one is kept. (not sure if it is by default) I do copy my
credentials across as a Symphony author but not sure if you keep the same for
members if they’d work - easiest way create a member and do a
manual/migration.

Probably simplest would be to import with the XML importer - then match the
old members id with the new member id - and update the password table
manually. (or with some fancy join queries)

@nitriques have added a textbox field for better filtering but none of the
filters work to search for the empty fields..

____

//$this- >dsParamFILTERS['844'] = 'not-regexp:^.+$';  
$this->dsParamFILTERS['844'] = 'regexp:^$';  
//$this->dsParamFILTERS['844'] = 'regexp:IS NULL';

____

$this- >dsParamFILTERS['844'] = 'regexp:^.+$'; (this works to find non-empty
fields)

Trying to fix `search_index` for PHP7. I followed all the suggestions from the
error msgs. I don’t know how to fix this part though:

         public function build($context) {
            $this->__prepareEdit($context);        
            parent::build($context);

I should be able to get on with the testing on my ‘large’ clients sometime

any caching it’s quite heavy!

yeah I would think the core is the same so if it shaves off per datasource
(excluding database itself) then there would be gains across I would think

comment](http://www.getsymphony.com/discuss/thread/112725/1/#position-6) in
the Symphony forum? It's worth to think about it at least, IMHO.
