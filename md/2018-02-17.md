Did anyone ever experience this JIT problem? I I only get those errors in
areas of white. The image shown was composed on a computer but the error also
happens in white areas of sky in photographies.

@wdebusschere Thanks for your quick reply and your hint to a solution â€“ I
downgraded JIT and got rid of the problem. Have a nice weekend!
