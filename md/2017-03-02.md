@nilshoerrmann Craft Looks Good and mature now. Have you used it yet?

@andrewminton No, we haven't used it in production. But we have been playing
around with it locally. It's quite similar to Symphony conceptually (without
the XML/XSLT dependency of course).

Migration capabilities would be something to scope out to see how it copes.
Wouldn 't want to leave clients hanging if the jump was made. There's still a
lot of great work put into Symphony, but so much has moved on in 6months. It
has a lovely UI.

@andrewminton @nilshoerrmann the pricing bit is a tad annoying, though I
appreciate money keeps the software going. Not sure if that would work with
some of the smaller clients.
