Guys.. <http://www.getsymphony.com/functions>

____

Does this need to be a valid page in order for string utilities to work?

____

My string-utilities functions are broken and it 's refering to these urls for
the xsl:string parts of the namespace

I don't think that there has ever been a file with the URL
<http://www.getsymphony.com/functions>. The namespaces `string`and `_string`
bind to this URL — that doesn't mean that there is a file. Please double-check
that you have EXSLT available, and that you have added the namespaces as
mentioned in the comments fo the utility.

must be something to do with my environment then. Sorry to bother you busy

No prob. Think of it like this: The URL "belongs to" the namespace. Try other
namespaces' URLs, and you will never find any files there.

copy of the filesystem and the database. I guess that there's something broken
in the database. Maybe @jonmifsud can help you with that.
