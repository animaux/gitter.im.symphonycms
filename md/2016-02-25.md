Guys.. <http://www.getsymphony.com/functions>

__ __

Does this need to be a valid page in order for string utilities to work?

__ __

My string-utilities functions are broken and it's refering to these urls for
the xsl:string parts of the namespace

I don't think that there has ever been a file with the URL
<http://www.getsymphony.com/functions>. The namespaces `string`and `_string`
bind to this URL — that doesn't mean that there is a file. Please double-check
that you have EXSLT available, and that you have added the namespaces as
mentioned in the comments fo the utility.

If the above isn't really a requirement for the url to be live/active then it
must be something to do with my environment then. Sorry to bother you busy

No prob. Think of it like this: The URL "belongs to" the namespace. Try other
namespaces' URLs, and you will never find any files there.

so the issue is stemming from toolkit &gt; class.entry.php

specifically the method getData() isn't returning an object, so then on page
load it's throwing a 500 error

i updated it to return a string now i have some php warnings rather than a 500

To debug this issue, I am afraid, a seasoned Symphony dev would need an exact
copy of the filesystem and the database. I guess that there's something broken
in the database. Maybe @jonmifsud can help you with that.
