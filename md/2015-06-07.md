It's a choice I would use the one which is serving the client so I keep the
same domain

Assumed that both webistes are not on the same server, but on comparable
hardware, you will have best performance if you use JIT URLs on the **giver
side**, because you will only need one HTTP request and one filesystem
request. If the URLs point to the **receiver side**, there will be two HTTP
requests (and the original image will have to me transferred over HTTP in case
the resulting image is not in the cache already).

To be more clear: The "second request" is always done by JIT. JIT always
checks if an original image is still available before sending the cached
version. If the original is in the filesystem, the check will be pretty fast.
If, however, the original is a remote image, this depends.

Yep it does seem faster to do the JIT on the giver side, also sending a
smaller image over too. I don't mind keeping the same domain in this case
because it's a link to the other site. Now I know how to do it both ways for
other projects :)
