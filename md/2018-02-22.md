> Some documentation available to create an extension?

@josealbertorodriguesjunior I wish it was. There is probably some older
partial documentation somewehre in the net. Currently the best you can do is
dissect existing extensions that do similar things you want to do. I’m happy
for someone to proof me wrong `;)`

@josealbertorodriguesjunior @animaux I collected a few resources a while ago:
symphonists/symphony-extensions-network#13

____

Any addition is welcome (and I really should put these resources into chapter
#2 of <https://github.com/symphonists/symphony-extensions-network)>

If you want to use it for backend table display the `backend_assets` should be
a good starting point.

@josealbertorodriguesjunior that would be interesting… any specific use-case?
Or just to speed-up table load via Ajax? (inline editing would require a
license I believe so not sure you could go that far)

`order_entries` and such.

I’ve done it on the frontend plenty of times; we’re working on web-apps these
days. I’ve not played enough with the table view to be able to tell you the
easiest `route` to do it.

____

But essentially I’d load all of the ajax data from an extension `content`
page. Then I guess with javascript start off by erasing data from the loaded
tables and re-loading it with datatables ajax version.

that’s the `quick` version… filters I’d leave them as they are just send them
via Javascript - those you should be able to pass on as-is to your function
(I’d look at how core filtering works)

I’d love to hang-around explain all the details of how to go about this… but
I’ve got a pile of work to get done…

@josealbertorodriguesjunior I think you’ll need to get a `brain-dump` from
some of the developers to get that done

yeah essentially what I’ve learnt was by looking at other extensions, hte core
and the APIs - at least those are good :)

I am thinking it might be beneficial to setup a mailchimp extension. We often
need Mailchimp integration on forms which are posted to Symphony events.

I'm thinking the extension could:

  * Add a mailchimp API key field to the preferences section.
  * Add a mailchimp default list ID field to the preferences section.
  * Make an event filter available for Symphony events which:
    * Checks for the presence of a field “email” in the post values
    * Checks for the presence of a checkbox field “opt-in” in the post values
    * If both are set, sends the email to the mailchimp list
    * Optionally also send "first-name” and “last-name” fields to Mailchimp if they are present in the post values.
    * Optionally also send the data to a different list if the field “mailchimp-list” is present in the post values This would override the default list ID set in the preferences.
  * Return the result in XML

There is already a [mailchimp
extension](http://symphonyextensions.com/extensions/mailchimp/), but it
doesn’t seem to integrate with Symphony events

Before we build this, I wondered if anyone has any thoughts about the
functionality? Any glaring omissions? Oh, and maybe someone has built it
already?

um I don’t know if we investigated and/or used this. I’ve done similar
integrations for other systems.

Keep in mind this will need to be a `filter` likely linked to a checkbox so
that it can be GDPR compliant

*ps if I did do this didn’t cover all of your list.

@nitriques \- what I meant, was that the existing extension doesn't seem to
have the functionality to send data to a Symphony section as well as to
Mailchimp.
