Best of both worlds. Ok that sounds like what symphony already is for me. And
until now I haven't any concerns about limits while I've build fairly large
websites with it without real customisations in the backend.

But is that true multi-site. So client 1 got his own admin and client 2 also,
etc.? Or just serving content on different domains?

@moretaste usually yes; but with the right delegate use and extension setup -
you can filter the results and only make certain entries available.

Great comments @nilshoerrmann. I feel we're mostly on the same page

__ __

I still like the idea of datasources, but think they might change a little bit
to be like JIT recipes

__ __

Data is accessible via an API at all times, but for complicated queries you
could roll it up

__ __

I'm not sure how I feel about multi site stuff, I wouldn't do anything to
prevent it, but I'm not sure I'd go out of the way to make it a core thing?

@brendo regarding data sources: following my idea, they wouldn’t change much.
As an „endpoint“ they just wouldn’t call a PHP function directly (`execute`
right now, if I remember correctly) but the API instead. Even remote and
static data sources would still exist as endpoints: either calling an external
API or returning static data. (I couldn’t live without remote data sources)

Hm

__ __

I kinda thought you'd hit `/api/data-sources/read-blog`

__ __

and that might actually be the same as
`/api/sections/blog?fields=title,body:formatted?sort=date`

__ __

I haven't thought about it too much though tbh

__ __

I was hoping that regardless of how data is stored, it should be accessible
via multiple formats

__ __

This library is an interesting take, <http://fractal.thephpleague.com/>

I'd recommend having a look at Babel then, authoring in ES6/7 is far more

That's true

For context, our company just shifted off PHP to use AWS Lambda

Lambda is a container that amazon spins up on demand to execute 'code'. It

Temando

__ __

Basically you just upload the code to Amazon

__ __

and then you expose it via an endpoint and configure the DNS etc.

__ __

Anytime you hit that endpoint, Amazon takes care of spinning up the instance
to run your code

__ __

but then after it finishes the request, it turns the box off

I still got problems with sending e-mail through smtp. The block on the server
has been removed. I have a simple script with phpmailer to send through smtp
and that works like a charm. But from symphony I still got the error
`Incorrect authentication data`.

On a test server the test-script works but symphony again not. The error there
is `Unable to open socket. Connection refused`. What sounds strange for me
because phpmailer isn't refused.

I never experienced problems like that. As far as I remember, you are using
ETM, right? In this case, can you try to send a simple "password forgotten"
email (which will only use the core, without ETM or other extensions)?
