does anyone use the TextBox field ? Not sure if I came across a bug introduced
with a Symphony update or something else. I’m having issues with
<https://github.com/psychoticmeow/textboxfield/blob/master/fields/field.textbox.php#L564>
where some non-markdown text is being double encoded `&amp;quot;` showing some
really ugly headlines.

Anything which is parsed by markdown(smartypants) uses numeric encoding
`&#8220;` so the double encoding doesn’t happen

@jonmifsud I do use it often, but never with smarty pants so I would guess the
issue is there...

____

I 'll check github ASAP

@nitriques the problem is not with smartypants but plain (no markdown)

markdown outputs just fine, I usually have headlines/titles etc to have no
markdown processing.

I think cdata would work, but I’m not sure if it could cause issues with
anything else. let me confirm

Cdata works `<![CDATA[Rabbi Angela Buchdahl sings &quot;Remember&quot;]]>` I
guess that shouldn’t impact anything except for any potential ninja xslt
processing?

____

Ah never mind that doesn’t work anyway… it seems

____

I get the exact same output in html...

____

`Rabbi Angela Buchdahl sings &quot;Remember&quot;` which is not what I want… I
need the actual quote marks
