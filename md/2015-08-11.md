I have to say

____

The filtering option in Order Entries scares me

____

Seems to be a little fickle at the moment adding/removing database schema

it’s giving you problems or it’s more in terms of the way it alters the

The latter

Wonder if it could be a solved with a different schema

____

like a filter column and have multiple rows

____

Or store JSON in a column to keep single rows

hmm as for multiple row approach, it’s a bit more complicated I guess.

____

because you can have partial / full combination of filters.

____

if it’s just a 1 field filter, works great but I have instances where I have
2+ filters.

actually it’s fine I think we can go with the multi row approach. adding a
‘field_id’ and a filter value. I would keep field_id stirng, in case of
complex structures (multi field) we could comma separate the ID’s and json the
values. Not sure if that makes sense.

____

alternatively an other field, which denotes the combination of filters (in
case of multiple filters) and each filter would reside on it’s own row.
probably cleaner and what you had in mind

Feels strange though, if you add 5 filters you’ve got to add 5 different
columns to the schema

except for the design preference. Had no complaints from the client, regarding
messed up orders. and it’s been in prod for a few months now

____

yeah that can probably be improved.

So how does that work now if you have 2 filters?

____

If you have filter a, b and then c (which is a+b combined), is that 3 columns?

It “should” be a mutually exclusive. So if you have Field A and Field B

____

each time you filter either Field A / Field B or both it would create a new
entry depending on your values.

____

So Field A would take ValueA and FieldB would take ValueB

____

so by default it combines your filters if you have 2 filters at the same time.

____

probably that might not always be wanted

So how does that work on the frontend then?

____

If Field A has the entry ordered at position 1, and then Field B has the entry
at position 5

____

If both fields are filtered on, at what position is the entyr?

Ah that’s probably where it could do a bit more. At the moment it checks the
datasource Filters

____

and returns the sort order matching the datasource filters

____

at least when ordering the items that’s what should happen. I think it also
works if you output the sort order

the filtering mechanism is the same for frontend/backend. So basically the
client has a system to choose which Items appear on the homepage / news page
etc. Each one is a ‘view’ of the same section with a different filter. On the
frontend I have the same datasource just using a separate ‘page’ filter.

____

It allows them to have a separate sort order for the same item. One on the
homepage say position 2 and on the news page position 1

But if you had 2 filters active

____

What value is stored

____

Or better, how is the value stored

____

I understand separate filters, like filter = home, pos 1

____

filter = has images, pos 2

____

but I don’t understand how it behaviours when filters stack

so page = home  & has images

[Aug 11 2015

It should be stored like this

order: 1; fieldA: valueA; fieldB: valueB;  
order: 2; fieldA: valueC; fieldB: valueD;

not sure if that multi thing is in prod or if I worked around it.

____

yes it does at the moment :) but if the schema is re-thought I just have to
keep that functionality in mind

____

I think it’s a useful feature. at least saved me a bunch of time / complexity
in the overall setup. I have around 14 filtered sort views at the moment for
this client.
