I’m trying to revive the [factory
project](http://www.getsymphony.com/discuss/thread/111791/1/). Willing to get
my team on it this summer. I’d appreciate some feedback from the community :)

@nitriques sounds like it fits. Actually, for my needs, don't need to change
much of what we already have. I love how mature and solid is Symphony today.
What I'm saying is that the template engine could be an extension instead a
core thing. Honestly, I don't have any clue how hard is to do that, also I
don't know what need to change in PHP and database side as that is really not
my expertise, from my point of view everything looks perfect.

__ __

Imagine the scenario: we can choose the language of the data structure (xml,
json, yml, php object - I already checked, all translatable), and then we can
choose the template engine (also checked, just need an entry point, that is
the pages currently, each template engine extension responsible to create the
basic page template in the proper format and then render it by the routes).

And well, XML + XSLT can still be the default, and thats great.

clarify that for me I appreciate. thanks!

I know that this totally NOT how things works, but just to exemplify that: 1)
data structure is translatable and 2) templating can be agnostic about
technology.

I believe what you are asking would mean data sources output arrays And/or
objects. Which are language agnostic And can be transformed to json or Xml

> <https://css-tricks.com/what-is-a-headless-cms/> well, finally the "web dev
community" is starting understand what Allen Chang already knew for much more
than a decade.

currently we dont have an api entry point, we have pages for rendering the
template. but in fact (which is awesome) we have behind the page an api entry
point (what we see on ?debug)... :)

__ __

thats because the symphony system is designed to be a CMS and a website. a
headless approach detach the website responsibility from the system and just
expose (with authentication or not) the restAPI.

__ __

Symphony is the most beautiful and powerful CMS I ever used, and as CMS I
mean: Sections, Data Sources and Events

did this makes sense for you?

Here is the pull request for better handling error cases and alternate
environments that I promised.  
<https://github.com/symphonycms/jit_image_manipulation/pull/119/files>

I found that the Symphony had changed it's behaviour when installing/disabling
extensions, and the return value no longer mattered; however any message
thrown in an exception is automatically shown to the user. So that's fixed as
well.

@neosatus I'm currently working on Symfony project too, and I had no prior
experience. My employer has never inquired about it, but I put Symphony CMS on
my resume as well. :D

I didn't have any problems learning it as I come from Zend Framework
background. In the end, most frameworks are pretty much the same.
