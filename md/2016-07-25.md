we are planning to!

the migration has not yet happened… the sys admin is a bit of a P/T guy and
the client pays him directly; there’s only so much I can speed up.

since I made a few tweaks and gained some .7s per page load… it went down the
client’s priority list… though they’re paying thousands per month in duplicate
hosting setups right now… so I think they’ll want to move it sooner rather
than later

____

same there if you have issues let me now :) but that seems to be what’s
working for us. Might be something better around
