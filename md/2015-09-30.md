@michael-e trying to use ENM for the first time - I’ve managed to get most of
it set up on Sym 2.6.3 (PRs will be coming shortly) but I can’t seem to be
able to get any emails sent via smtp using mailtrap for testing purposes.
(trying locally on OSX cli seems to be enabled)

Ajax seems stuck on the following. Any clues of where to look would be
appreciated.

the times I couldn't send e-mail with the email template manager it was due to
not setting a from name and from email. But I guess you check that already.

ETM I’m familiar with but ENM sets it’s own recipient etc. So I could be doing
something wrong not exactly sure how to check because no ENM logs are showing
up, so I’m thinking it might not even be triggering

before all the symphony classes were responsible of calling their dependencies
if I recall correctly, the auto loader offsets that by saying if you don’t
find a class try to locate it in this particular folder (depending on
structure / file names)

____

in short but you’d have to look at it to understand

____

yeah it triggers and seems like all the mail was sent. so I’t just a question
of finding the source of the logs and why it happens

ah got it I think, so no need for include anymore, autoload detects
automatically the path to the class and better in terms of maintenance

If I recall events had a redirect option, where you can pass the redirect url,
and once the event suceeds it would automatically redirect the page. that said
I’ve never really used it as I work with AJAX based forms nowadays gives a
better experience.

What I like to achieve is that I already get clean urls based on post values
so people could bookmark or send a nice url by e-mail. Through an event I set
the params and the filter on the datasource is working as expected. Only the
url doesn't change

desired destination / url.

With option A I could also 'ajaxifying' the form idd. B could be an option but
I think not with php if the page is already build before the event fires.

you can trigger option B after the event fires. it will then load a new
symphony page with the url which is redirected

you might want to look at :
<http://symphonyextensions.com/extensions/dynamic_event_redirect/> if you’re
building urls dynamically. I

sorry not sure if that is supported any more

____

but standard functionality for redirect would be this:

    
    
    <input name= "redirect" type=“hidden" value="http://yourwebsite.com/url/" />

____

once successful your page should be redirected to the indicated url

then you should be able to do `->Params()` and/or `->Env()`not sure if any

depending on php you might have to fist put it in a variable then get the
