@michael-e trying to use ENM for the first time - I’ve managed to get most of
it set up on Sym 2.6.3 (PRs will be coming shortly) but I can’t seem to be
able to get any emails sent via smtp using mailtrap for testing purposes.
(trying locally on OSX cli seems to be enabled)

Ajax seems stuck on the following. Any clues of where to look would be
appreciated.

the times I couldn't send e-mail with the email template manager it was due to
not setting a from name and from email. But I guess you check that already.

ETM I’m familiar with but ENM sets it’s own recipient etc. So I could be doing
something wrong not exactly sure how to check because no ENM logs are showing
up, so I’m thinking it might not even be triggering

autoloader is one of the things on my list I like to understand what it does

before all the symphony classes were responsible of calling their dependencies
if I recall correctly, the auto loader offsets that by saying if you don’t
find a class try to locate it in this particular folder (depending on
structure / file names)

__ __

in short but you’d have to look at it to understand

__ __

yeah it triggers and seems like all the mail was sent. so I’t just a question
of finding the source of the logs and why it happens

ah got it I think, so no need for include anymore, autoload detects
automatically the path to the class and better in terms of maintenance

I can set page parameters with the form through post but they aren't shown in
the url

so I guess an event happens after the initial page build through symphony?

If I recall events had a redirect option, where you can pass the redirect url,
and once the event suceeds it would automatically redirect the page. that said
I’ve never really used it as I work with AJAX based forms nowadays gives a
better experience.

What I like to achieve is that I already get clean urls based on post values
so people could bookmark or send a nice url by e-mail. Through an event I set
the params and the filter on the datasource is working as expected. Only the
url doesn't change

Two options I guess, a) javascript history js b) redirect with a 301/2 to the
desired destination / url.

With option A I could also 'ajaxifying' the form idd. B could be an option but
I think not with php if the page is already build before the event fires.

__ __

I think there will be an header already sent issue

you can trigger option B after the event fires. it will then load a new
symphony page with the url which is redirected

__ __

you might want to look at :
<http://symphonyextensions.com/extensions/dynamic_event_redirect/> if you’re
building urls dynamically. I

__ __

sorry not sure if that is supported any more

__ __

but standard functionality for redirect would be this:

    
    
    <input name="redirect" type=“hidden" value="http://yourwebsite.com/url/" />

__ __

once successful your page should be redirected to the indicated url

that’s an option :) obviously once the redirect happens you lose the ‘event’
data from the XML just so you are not surprised

it’s support levels (or it has worked throughout and nobody bothered updating)

it does set the header but it also returns the browser reads your 301/2 and
loads a new page

Symphony::Engine() - should give you a FrontendPage instance if not mistaken

then you should be able to do `->Params()` and/or `->Env()`not sure if any
would be populated and with what at that stage

it would be $page-&gt;Params()['current-page']

depending on php you might have to fist put it in a variable then get the
value. Also check that the params array has the values you want/need.
