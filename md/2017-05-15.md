@michael-e I believe it’s only some minor changes; but if it’s properly
promoted I think saying that we support 3.0 even if by default it works with
1.0 could be a boost. I agree that other than making things simpler it will
not change much.

@michael-e @jonmifsud the ability to read/write JSON is quite a big deal I
think.

@animaux not as big as you think; can easily get that done with existing
scripts; so we can cater for that with a flag/option/extension to create XML
and output JSON

Hmn. I wonder if it would reduce overhead to be able to do all that directly.

Apart from that. Sure you can do it all in `XSLT 1.0` with helper
templates/functions/EXSLT and so on. But I imagine it to be quite nice to have
that all ready to use at hand. Especially when it comes to grouping and
finding unique entries. That kind of stuff.

@michael-e it seems like `/data/events/member-login-info/@result = 'success'`
is there all the time when a user is logged in. Isn’t that supposed to be only
visible directly after login?

I think that this attribute has always been there. I am not really sure that
it follows the same logic as `@logged-in`. I always use `@logged-in` or `@id`.

Ok, thanks. I thought I could use it as an indicator if a login-process has
just completed successfully. But I have used another approach anyway. `:)`
