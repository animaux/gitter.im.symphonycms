Hi guys. Could someone please do me a huge favor and **make an instance of
symphony with already included out of the box symphony-2-template**?

@nitriques I wonder - why not change that old outdated look for something
brand new - already included - like that template? it's open source anyway.

@diomed I think the main question is time + design effort. Making a fresh new
build for a learning-focused demo site will take quite an effort.

@nitriques I did some research and it looks like this is UNIX script, while
I'm on windows, so apparently that won't help me much, huh?

Sadly, not. But I do run this script on Windows, in git bash

@nitriques would it be too much to ask of you to make me a finished bundle?

@nitriques I hope maybe you could offer this instance as an alternative to
official one?

Well I could. But I would have to automate the releases since we update the
package multiple times a week
