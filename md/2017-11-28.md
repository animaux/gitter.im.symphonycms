It’s like the mars landing. Always a few years in the future `:)`

Guys. I’m trying to filter a section by `@id` of sections the entries are
linked to.

____

If I use `23,26,33` as filter, it shows all the entries that have at least one
matching linked section  @id.

____

What do I use as a delimiter if I want the returned entries to have links to
`ALL` `@id`s in the list?

____

`+` is not working

Is it possible the DS interprets the page param value of `18+19` as a literal
string rather than two values connected by a logical `AND`?

URL-Encoding doesn’t help either.

Is this a problem with the `association field`?

Are it’s filtering options the same as with it’s parent
`selectbox_link_field`?

To rephrase my ramblings in a single question: How can I filter a section by
multiple linked field-ids in an `association_field` with a logical `AND`? It
seems it is only possible to use a `,` as a logical `OR`.

@animaux if the field supports it, it should be `+`

____

(notice the space BEFORE and AFTER the + symbol)

D’oh! m( Thanks @nitriques I think the missing space were borking things up.
Expected that to work the same as with the commas.

____

That will render some ugly URLs though. `:/`

____

We can’t use (e)xsl-functions in DS-Filters, can we?

no: filter are not passed down to the xslt engine

____

we needed the spaces because 1) spaces can be encoded usign + in urls 2) to
allow to search values with a literal + in them

____

and yes `%20%2B%20`is ugly... but it works
