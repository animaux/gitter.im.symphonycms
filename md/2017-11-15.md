Me again! We have a recurring issue with Markdown where clients paste URLs in
the Markdown editor. They look fine in the editor (and in the database) but
when the content is rendered, the slashes in the URLs are replaced with
`%E2%80%8B`.

The problem occurs when they copy an image URL from a Symphony upload field,
but not if they copy the image URL from the browser address bar.

We are using `<xsl:copy of select="content/node()" />` to output the
(formatted) content from the datasource. I wonder if this could be a database
encoding issue. Has anyone experienced this?

@stuartgpalmer how is the content in ?debug and how is the content in the
database?

@wdebusschere the content looks fine in the debug view:

`<p><img src="/​workspace/​uploads/​page-​images/​adonz-​logo-​1-​002-.​jpg"
alt="ADONZ logo" title="ADONZ logo" /></p>`

But renders as:

`<p><img
src="/%E2%80%8Bworkspace/%E2%80%8Buploads/%E2%80%8Bpage-%E2%80%8Bimages/%E2%80%8Badonz-%E2%80%8Blogo-%E2%80%8B1-%E2%80%8B002-.%E2%80%8Bjpg"
alt="ADONZ logo" title="ADONZ logo"></p>`

Perhaps I am missing something in the xsl statement?

@stuartgpalmer do you have other symphony sites on this webserver?
