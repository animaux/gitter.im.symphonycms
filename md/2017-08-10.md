I’ve sent a symphonists/reflectionfield#37 to reflect this (sic!) in the
captions.

Hey @/all who reported a problem with the key on textboxfield ?? I can find
the reference ...

____

@jonmifsud yup not used anymore in the core... We kept it in 2.x because some
extensions might use it

It’s only used by AI Selector, which will need to be updated for `3.0.0` then

____

I have a fork that brings it’s own selectize.js, but there might be better
alternatives by now.

____

The whole Association Interface insn’t flourishing like I hoped it would … I
still rely on it for all of my projects.

At some point there were more extensions using it I think.

____

If we get rid of the HTMLpurifier too, the basic Symphony Installation will
becom quite lean.

____

@nitriques I have only found a reference to textbox back in march:

Probably not what you meant.

@animaux thanks, but no... it was related to a key being too big (more than
1000 chars)

____

well I still have a bunch of email from github to read, so maybe it is in
there

____

past 3 days have been hell, since we have part of our staff on their summer
vacations

____

but today.. Symphony all day !!!

@nitriques are you referring to the entry in the other gitter channel (the
help channel)?

> Now, I guess I stumbled upon some bug yesterday. Creating a section with a
Text Box (in the brand new Symphony) always results in the SQL error
“Specified key was too long; max key length is 1000 bytes”. And to turn it
into a kind of question: should I better add this to Issues on the extension’s
Github page?

Anyone know if there's a way to disable the default /symphony url path? I've
created a custom path (awesome feature btw), but can I make that the only
access point to Symphony?
