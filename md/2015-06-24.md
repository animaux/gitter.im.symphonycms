@nitriques thanks I’ll have a look at the PR later

@michael-e came across a potential bug from ETM. I’m uploading some files to
S3 from javascript and my field takes an array of data - it’s also linked to
an ETM form which seems to submit but I get 500 server errors relating to the
content of `etm-post-files` param. Any idea why that’s generated I don’t
recall seeing / having problems with it before.

@michael-e might have figured out it has something with my post structure
being an array. Looking at the snippet and will send a PR to fix once I figure
it out.

    
    
    fields[files][mimetype][1]:application/pdf
    fields[files][filepath][1]:start-a-project/filename-1435123437.pdf
    fields[files][filename][1]:filename.pdf

I am a bit lost here, what is the `etm-post-files` param? I don't remember ETM
having such a parameter. Could it be that you are using a hacked version?

unlikely that it’s a hacked version something I set up relatively recently for
my site. `$etm-post-files` is related to my field being named `files` I’ll
double check on the ETM version / repo and get back.

seems like it’s on the latest master. Issue arises from the `_sendEmail`
function as it converts the post values to the param array. It doesn’t deal
with anything which is not a string (in my case array)

Ah, I remember now, `$etm-post-something` was added via a pull request:
creativedutchmen/email_template_manager#61

yeah that’s the one. I can modify the function but not sure what makes sense
in case of arrays...

____

I’ve looped over with the `.key` for the first level. Then if there’s a
secondary array I’ve joined them with a comma - I don’t exactly use this but
would rather get a proper fix in for anyone who might

Sorry, I can't think about it at the moment. Maybe later today. Could you
track it on Github (and bump the conversation it if you don't hear from me)?
