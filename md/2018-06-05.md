Guys, is there a way to enforce a password strength for Symphony backend? I am
thinking this might be handy concerning the new GDPR rules, as a way to
support data security.

@michael-e Is there a way to prevent that a memberaccount is being used twice
at the same time?

@wdebusschere yes, I use these two approaches, but still. I think this -
controling password strength - is a security feature on its own. Actually, now
I tried to create a user with just one character password and it worked. Well,
with this kind of loosenes you can not say you did everything for the
security. Under contrary, isn't this kind of a system vulnerability?

@jurajkapsz Usually its an administrator that creates the authors, he should
be aware of this. For the members (extension) you can set the password length

We also use a custom admin path

> Good luck! We have plenty of ML site with 2.7.6 clean installs or updated
with latest version of all language extensions.. working perfect

@wdebusschere Thanks! OK, I've tried ML on a clean Symphony 2.6.x install too
and also I don't get any ML data returned in datasources. This must be some
kind of bummer on my side. Probably I will walk for a week with a bucket on my
head if I find out. I'll go all over again with everything, what to do. Will
let you know. Thanks.

Yes, but authors can change their passwords later on... I asume users in
general do.

> For the members (extension) you can set the password length

Yes, I know, but I use basic backends in general.

> We also use a custom admin path

Yes, that's a good practice.

All in all, I will create a feature request about this onto github just to
have it logged for consideration.

@wdebusschere thanks a lot! well, before that I make some more attempts just
not to waste your time with some silliness. I am aware this has to work.
Thanks again.

@wdebusschere Re: Member login — AFAIK, a Member can always log in with
several devices or browsers. You would have to get your hands dirty if you
need to prevent this. (You would have to find existing sessions and destroy
them. Which isn't too complicated, because you know the Member's username upon
login.)

@michael-e So upon login check if in sym_sessions if there are entries with
the username and delete them?

I am not sure how to do it. Simply deleting sessions from the table is rather
"brutal". :-) But I don't know if the Symphony API allows a different
approach.

I would need the current member to stay logged in and the 2nd not to be able
to login

until the 1st has logged out

Checking if the Member is already logged in should be possible by "plugging
into" the Members extension. But your scenario will cause a lot of headache.
People never log out, and then they can not log in from another device. I hope
you have the support power to manage this.

Yep, that would be a solution. Still, I wonder how many support requests that
would generate. :-)

Members need to pay for an account, so we don't want them to use the same
logins, any alternative solution?

Hmmm, unfortunately I have no idea. Even with your solution, multiple people
could use the same account, just not at the same time.

@wdebusschere that’s usually hard to determine in particular with GDPR you
would need to explain what information you collect.

____

I’ve seen companies who try fingerprinting. Eg linking a device depending on
browser / desktop size etc to try determine if there are multiple users but
its not 100% accurate
