Thanks Jon. Ideally I needed to be able to have a set of fields that can be
repeated as often as I want inside a single entry. In other words: entries
bundled inside an entry.

ah it doesn’t quite do entries

____

however the guy who created it had mentioned that that was the next logical
step.. not sure if he ever did it.

It’s easy to achieve that via Associations, but a backend display of all
grouped entries would be nice.

I find dynamic text field really useful. E.g. for employment history on job
applications. Its much faster and simpler to view than associations. It does
seem to be a bit buggy - its not possible to add two DTG fields to the same
section, but that can be avoided by working directly with the DB or building
the field in a new section and changing the section.

Extensions which expand on the relationship between entries and allow entries
within entries seem the be the ones which make most difference to the Symphony
experience IMHO

@stuartgpalmer thanks. It looks like it could use some love though, or is
there a fork taht runs on current symphony versions?
<http://symphonyextensions.com/extensions/dynamictextgroup/>

____

I guess it should be possible to plug into the associations-suite in order to
create a chained set of entries.

____

Basically it would need a different interface for the AI selector and have the
AI editor overlays always open below the main entry. And on save it would need
to save all grouped entries on save. :thought_balloon: hmmm.

Extensions are also an issue, though a lot of important ones already support
`PHP 7`. And those who don’t are mostly very easy to fix.
