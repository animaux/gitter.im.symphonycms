Will Symphony `2.7`introduce changes that likely break extensions, or is this
only due with `3.0`?

but there’s a good chance it will not be a major change if most extensions had

Though there will possibly be some stuff inside the extensions that might
break with PHP7?

I guess there was some consent about interface elements in Symphony being text
rather than icons?

____

Apart from that I always modify the editor page overlay with custom CSS via
`backend_assets`.

The page-sheet-like appearance is easily overlooked and misunderstood, so I
like to add some padding to the overlay and a more brutal shadow. That makes
it clearer there's actually something ON TOP.

I have a set of CSS I usually apply to a new Symphony installation by default,
some of it of course to lean forward the CD of the customer.

F. e. in the indexes I like to make the actual links to the entries easier to
distinguish from other possible links in the table.

I also had a ‘sample’ extension which distinguishes items in an Association
Field by colour (client eventually said they didn’t need it) but someone else
might find it useful.
