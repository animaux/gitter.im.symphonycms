Will Symphony `2.7`introduce changes that likely break extensions, or is this
only due with `3.0`?

`3.0` might, `2.7` should be backward compatible

Ah sorry correction `3.0` will/might break somet things

but there’s a good chance it will not be a major change if most extensions had
been updated when items were deprecated.

Ok, but good enough to see PHP7-support coming with a _not-too-major_ update

Though there will possibly be some stuff inside the extensions that might
break with PHP7?

I'd like to test my websites on PHP7 in 2 or 3 months.

the question is to get the best of editing + dragging

ordering is usually more important than the edit (depending on the application

I guess there was some consent about interface elements in Symphony being text
rather than icons?

__ __

Apart from that I always modify the editor page overlay with custom CSS via
`backend_assets`.

The page-sheet-like appearance is easily overlooked and misunderstood, so I
like to add some padding to the overlay and a more brutal shadow. That makes
it clearer there's actually something ON TOP.

Will try some stuff and show it to you guys in order to discuss.

I have a set of CSS I usually apply to a new Symphony installation by default,
some of it of course to lean forward the CD of the customer.

F. e. in the indexes I like to make the actual links to the entries easier to
distinguish from other possible links in the table.

I also had a ‘sample’ extension which distinguishes items in an Association
Field by colour (client eventually said they didn’t need it) but someone else
might find it useful.
