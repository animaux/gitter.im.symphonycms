symphonists/encrypted_input#2

____

The extension only shows the encrypted field contents in the backend once
saved. Might be nice to have it human-readable after saving as well.

I guess when populating `encrypted_input`fields via `xml_importer` it would
need some special logic to actually encrypt the content?

@animaux not sure; I wouldn’t think so. But it depends if encrypted_input is
handling imported data as pre-processed

____

Is it saving data un-encrypted?

Looks like in encrypts on entry-saving/creation and only decrypts in the DS-
output

____

I guess it would have to be pre-processed if there is no special function.

hi, I m following an old but interesting post from Brendo for submitting to
multiple sections ... so I changed the event to this:

    
    
        public function load(){
            $this->post = $_POST;
            if(isset($_POST['action'][$this->ROOTELEMENT])) return $this->__trigger();
        }
    
        protected function __trigger(){
            unset($_POST['fields']);
            $_POST['fields'] = $this->post[$this->ROOTELEMENT]['fields'];
            $_POST['id'] = $this->post[$this->ROOTELEMENT]['id'];
    
            include(TOOLKIT . '/events/event.section.php');
    
          return $result;
      }

But I get an error `Undefined class constant 'ROOTELEMENT'`

____

I read some discussions about that but do 'n understand it complete

Ok, if it’s not in there I wouldn’t know either :·) It’s a bit outdated by now
I guess.

____

@brendo might maybe even answer if you post you problem right there.

____

Not sure if he’s around here often recently.

@moretaste <https://gist.github.com/brendo/901476#gistcomment-363005> Any

Yes it is some outdated (pity it isn't updated) but I thought simply change
`self::ROOTELEMENT` to `$this->ROOTELEMENT` would do the trick

hahaha small steps indeed and try to understand. It is something with
constants and variables and scope ... but I m missing the overall scope :D
