Ca you manipulate the $dsParamREQUIREDPARAM values in the DS?

@SeanVella I’m afraid not. Only via a custom DS probably.

Thats what I am trying to do at the moment. But I can't quite get the hang of
dsParamREQUIREDPARAM s

I presume you could set it based in what page youre on, or something like
that.

Yes, thats what I'm currently doing:

__ __

public function processParameters($context){

    
    
        //only 1 required param can be set. Use the correct one according to the page we are on
        switch ($context['param']['current-page']) {
            case 'rabbis':
                $this->dsParamREQUIREDPARAM = '$rabbi';
                break;
    
            case 'red-state-jews':
                unset($this->dsParamREQUIREDPARAM);
                break;
    
            case 'forward-50':
            case 'top-news':
            case 'best-of':
            case 'soundtrack':
                $this->dsParamREQUIREDPARAM = '$name';
                break;
        }
        parent::processParameters($context);
    
    }

oops

__ __

the : unset($this-&gt;dsParamREQUIREDPARAM); gives a 404

__ __

also tried to set it as null, but still having the same problem. The others
seem to work though.

No idea how to solve that, but you could do the same thing without the
`dsParamREQUIREDPARAM`. E. G. only execute the DS if certain conditions are
met.

I'll just create a new DS for this case study.. that will surely work with no
effort at all

thanks for you help though :)

Do you unset in the `execute` function? I had once an issue with multiple
filters that I had to unset

__ __

<http://www.getsymphony.com/discuss/thread/108181/#position-15>

__ __

    
    
        public function execute(array &$param_pool = null)
        {
            // RESET FILTER IF URL PARAM IS NOT SET
            // http://www.getsymphony.com/discuss/thread/108181/
            if (empty($this->_env['param']['url-racking-load'])) {
                unset($this->dsParamFILTERS['442']);
            }
    
            $result = new XMLElement($this->dsParamROOTELEMENT);
    ...
