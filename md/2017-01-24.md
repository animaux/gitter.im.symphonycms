@nitriques &amp; @michael-e you both beat us it seems we tally just above
150,000 entries for our largest system/client.

__ __

but we do have a table for another client (for which we’re not storing some
data in entries) which goes over 300,000. Though that covers a dataset of 3
languages.

@nitriques Two questions regarding PHP support.

a.) Will there be a Symphony `2.6.x` version that runs on PHP7?  
b.) Will PHP7 be a requirement for `2.7.x`?

__ __

I’m asking because some of our customers providers are pushing hard towards
PHP7.

Thanks Nicolas. Good to know as it’s not reflected in the 2.7.x readme yet.

And you said most of the extensions have no issues with PHP7?
