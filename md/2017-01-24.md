@nitriques & @michael-e you both beat us it seems we tally just above 150,000
entries for our largest system/client.

____

but we do have a table for another client (for which we’re not storing some
data in entries) which goes over 300,000. Though that covers a dataset of 3
languages.

@nitriques Two questions regarding PHP support.

a.) Will there be a Symphony `2.6.x` version that runs on PHP7?  
b.) Will PHP7 be a requirement for `2.7.x`?

____

I’m asking because some of our customers providers are pushing hard towards
PHP7.

Thanks Nicolas. Good to know as it’s not reflected in the 2.7.x readme yet.

____

And you said most of the extensions have no issues with PHP7?
