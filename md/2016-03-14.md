@bernardodiasc what you discussed was brought up for `Symphony Next`a good
while ago. I think there was concensus that the approach was right, the
problem was getting hands on deck to do the change, and giving the necessary
guidelines.

@bernardodiasc A related concept is called Hexagonal Architecture, which aims
to make the application independent of any particular input, output or
persistence formats. I don't know of any CMS that follows this type of
architecture, but it has potential to make CMS super easy to integrate into
larger systems, especially with the popularity of microservice type
architectures.

If got a working datasource filter like: `not-regexp: verkocht|ingetrokken`
but this also exclude 'verkocht onder voorbehoud'. Any possibility to include
the latter in the results?

if you add a `$` at the end which would signify end of string. does that do
the trick?

I think at the very end because the | is an or for both.

____

but I haven’t played much with regexp

mmm Cache has expired or does not exist. It says

____

And I extended the included elements but those aren 't show. So I thought
there was a cache problem.

____

`/ObjectenLijst/Object[contains('{$ds-bestaande-
bouw.ObjectSystemID}',ObjectSystemID) or contains('{$ds-bestaande-bouw-
random.ObjectSystemID}',ObjectSystemID) or contains('{$ds-
virtualtour.ObjectSystemID}',ObjectSystemID)]`. The first two are shown but
the last one not. If I do a `<xsl:value select="$ds-
virtualtour.ObjectSystemID"`, there is an output.

____

____
