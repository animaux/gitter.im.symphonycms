Can anyone walk me through the process by which
`SectionDatasource::$_fieldPool` is populated at a high level? I've got a data
source which has all the correct data in the database, but most of the fields
are missing from the pool array at the front end.

Got it, it's in `processEntry()`.

OK, it's `self::$_fieldPool[$field_id]->appendFormattedElement($xEntry,
$values, ($this->dsParamHTMLENCODE === 'yes' ? true : false), $mode,
$entry->get('id'));` that's failing.

All the fields which are just the `$handle` (eg, `product-id`) are coming
through in the XML correctly, but none of the ones that have a mode (eg,
`price: formatted`) are being omitted.

This is in 2.7.x BTW. It could be a bug.

____

But more likely the array format 's changed.

Nope, it's something in the Multilingual Textbox extension.

Hey Benjamin would love to help you out but really tight on time todyay
presume this is something you need sorted urgently? @nitriques also uses the
multilingual textbox pretty much for all his projects so he might/should have
come across it.

he’d be around in around 3-4hours usually as he’s based in Canada (Montreal)

I'm currently working through the code to narrow down where the error's
actually happening, so will let you know either way. :)

____

Got it. Both `FLang::getLangCode()` and `FLang::getMainCode()` are `string(0)
""`

____

Question is, why… o.o

`getMainLang()`, sorry.

Because `$langs = Symphony::Configuration()->get('langs',
'frontend_localisation');` is `NULL`. That'd do it.
