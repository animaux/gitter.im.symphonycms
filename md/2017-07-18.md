Any updates on utf8mb4 support for futures updates? I see that
symphonycms/symphony-2#2315 from 2015 but no news since.

Since "future versions" will start from 3.0, they may introduce breaking
changes (or changes which do require some manual fiddling with the database).
So I am pretty sure that 4-byte support will be there in 3.0, but there will
probably not be a painless upgrade path from 2.7.

Busy days here. Great work @nitriques and the team for the 2.7 release, gratz.
I'm into magento for the last two months for several projects (external) so
not that active at the moment with symphony.

Beautiful case with snipcart also  @nitriques :thumbsup:
