Hola

__ __

Yeah JIT 2.x...

__ __

I was actually a bit surprised my branch got promoted so quickly :P

__ __

JIT for me is a perfect example of something that I'd like to totally decouple
from Symphony so that it can be used by other websites

__ __

It should have an adapter so Symphony can use it, but the core of manipulating
the images should be totally decoupled from Symphony

__ __

I was heading in that direction, but didn't get back to it in time

__ __

JIT for me is a low hanging fruit as something that can be unit tested and
published as an independent Composer package

__ __

So I'll try to pick it up again soon

__ __

As for an update on what I've done recently, the answer is not a lot

__ __

I have started to pull apart the installer, and have introduced a `conductor`
console app, similar to `artisan` for Laravel

__ __

At the moment all it can do it a server check to make sure it meets the
requirements, but I will be fleshing it out to do installation and update
