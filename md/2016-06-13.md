Hola

____

Yeah JIT 2.x...

____

I was actually a bit surprised my branch got promoted so quickly :P

____

JIT for me is a perfect example of something that I 'd like to totally
decouple from Symphony so that it can be used by other websites

____

It should have an adapter so Symphony can use it, but the core of manipulating
the images should be totally decoupled from Symphony

____

I was heading in that direction, but didn 't get back to it in time

____

JIT for me is a low hanging fruit as something that can be unit tested and
published as an independent Composer package

____

So I 'll try to pick it up again soon

____

As for an update on what I 've done recently, the answer is not a lot

____

I have started to pull apart the installer, and have introduced a `conductor`
console app, similar to `artisan` for Laravel

____

At the moment all it can do it a server check to make sure it meets the
requirements, but I will be fleshing it out to do installation and update
