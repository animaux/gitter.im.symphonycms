@munki-boy remote datasource in combination with xml importer could do the
trick. Or maybe through an excel file

@munki-boy remote ds + xml importer is the best combination. just make sure
you’re using the latest version (or integration) if still not released.

Thanks guys, I've been using remote ds for incoming RSS feed. I'll try it in
combination with xml importer.

Thanks Jon, I'll read up first then let you know which points I didn't get.

@moretaste that's pretty cool, in this case it's just a bunch of data once at
the start of the project.

I've mostly used it for the first content, at least a lot faster than copy
paste ;-)

I just can't seem to get the remote datasource to get my local file. If I

paste the rss into a local file I just get

Mmm, it does stuff when I upload the file to a web server then consume it from
there. Either a windows thing or a same domain thing is wrong?

Something to do with WAMP that I don't know, I can just put the file in any
other folder it seems to work.

I'm now able to use the remote datasource and xml importer to import stuff
from an external file :) thanks everyone.
