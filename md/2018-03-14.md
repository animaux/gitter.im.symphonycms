@nitriques any idea why `fetchByPage`might return say 10 results and say there
should be a total of 14 results. (paginated by 25/pp) then paginated by 10;
says there are 14 but returns 7? I’ve not quite wrapped my head around the
query I’m sending so there must be something funny happening somewhere

Theres a legacy redirection to a symphony site I’m working on that directs to
`/wordpress/index.php` which ends up in an endless redirection loop. I cannot
edit the redirection currently. Is there a way I could catch this via a
`.htaccess` rewrite? I tried using the URL Routes extension with no success.

Does `/wordpress/index.php` exist? If so, does a redirection happen in the PHP
file? I think you can catch anything in `.htaccess`. Check that the browser
isn't caching the redirection after your change. Even with dev tools open and
caching disabled, Firefox can be funny with redirections. Exit and reopen.
Otherwise, exactly from what and to what do you want to redirect?

@cylkee no it doesn’t. I was unsuccessful with my htaccess-foo so far. Thanks
for the hints. I might as well create the folder/file to catch that! Didn’t
think of that yet `;)`

Very dirty!

Apparently the DNS-entry is hardlinked to /wordpress/index.php `m(`

AFAIK, DNS can not do this. How have you tested this?

@jonmifsud is the count in the xml right ? or wrong ?

____

@animaux do you have multiple domains on the website ? If not, I would bet it
is in the .htaccess file (or files check sub directories) or even maybe
directly in the httpd.conf file

@nitriques the count attribute in XML shows 14; when I see a total of 10
entries in XML

(this is a custom query/datasource not a standard one) but its odd that the
sum and actual results don’t match

____

yep last page;

____

on the first page a weird thing happens; paginated by 10; I get 7 results (out
of 14)

I would check the "$group" parameter

____

this adds a  "DISTINCT" clause to the SQL, which might affect the count

oh I’ll check that; I’ll try to dissect it as soon as I have some time to
figure it out.

@nitriques it’s all messed up. Good luck it’s not really my problem `;)` Just
needed a temp workaround.
