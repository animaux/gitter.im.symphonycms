Hi all, thanks to @wdebusschere I know that we can use the Members plugin with
two members sections, but I want to verify that It works fine and there is no
significant issue with using this functionality. Can someone (who used this
functionality) please confirm me that this functionality is working fine and
stable ?. Thanks !

A nice (german) rant about AMP, since this was a topic here recently:
<http://blog.fefe.de/?ts=a4c7f7df> I can help with a translation if Google
fails `:)`

@wdebusschere Thanks, but there were some posts that the functionality is not
working properly (sorry I can't find that post at the moment). That's why I
asked.

When filtering on a core _optional_ Date field in the DS UI (Sym 2.6.3, I
know), is it possible in a single DS to include entries with empty fields
alongside, say, `equal to or later than {$today}` entries, or do I need to get
dirty with the PHP file? And how does one match an empty Date field because
none of `sql: NULL`, `regexp: ^$`, `not-regexp: .+` or `0` works.
