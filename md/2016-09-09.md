Hey Symphonists, I have a Symphony page that should return JSON. Ideally, I’d
like to generate an XML structure in my templates and let Symphony convert
that to JSON. I’ve googled and found some reeeally old threads about that kind
of conversions (like this old issue by @brendo on Github:
<https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/issues/698)>. How would you do this
with Symphony nowadays? Is there an extension that does XML to JSON
conversions only (no fancy API things)? Thanks!

Just curious, why don't you do it in XSLT?

That was my first thought but looking at existing templates, this can get very
nasty.

____

Have you done this? Any templates you’d recommend?

No, I haven't. But at first glance something like [XSLTJSON
Lite](https://github.com/bramstein/xsltjson#xsltjson-lite-xslt-10-compatible)
might be a good start. However, I must admit that I don't know how JSONML
looks...

Well, that template does actually work quite well …

Actually, it does not work as expected …

____

I’m currently testing the fourth template and they either return strange
structures or invalid JSON.

Oh.

____

Regarding the structure of JSON built from XML, there seem to be a lot of
ideas.

____

Some of them have  "fish" in the name, which may be an omen.

Well, I have to conform to a certain JSON format so I don’t have to deal with
attribute conversions an such. Shouldn’t be that problematic actually. But you
know: theory and reality …

In this case, can't you simply pimp the template that I linked to? Conversion
might be simple if you create an XML structure that fits well.

Yes, of course, it’s not the first time, I have to write XSL ;) I was just
thinking there might already be a general solution to handle XML to JSON
conversions. That’s why I was asking :)

____

The easiest solution would be, if I just had to add a JSON type to my page and
Symphony magically converted the output to JSON.

I vaguely remember discussions about this... But AFAIK, you will have to build
an extension if you want to do this in Symphony 2.x.

I think there might be something around which does that conversion you want
@nilshoerrmann \- if not there definitely are utilities which do XML to JSON
conversion not sure if the output would be exactly the way you want it though
