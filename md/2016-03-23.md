@animaux no; they should be leaving today to Zurich and/or Paris, and then
find a way down

Good luck to them! I guess it’s still a traffic-mess anywhere near brussels

the first time. Fun!

Ok new import question. Can I import two values into an association. Thus
`imgteaser-nl/item/title-nl/@handle and imgbanner-nl/item/title-nl/@handle`
(but that expression gives an error)

What about `//item/title-nl/@handle` then?

____

Ah no.

Forget it. I did not see the whole thing : )

Can someone explain what's wrong with this: `<xsl:value-of
select="concat('?c=', //data/params/url-c, '&p=$')" />`

The error message isn't being helpful, says it expects a ; where the second =
is. I'll try that.

____

And that 's why I come here, thanks for the help. :D

Got a new question: I'm passing a part number to a data source as a param but
it's changing spaces into %20 but then not converting it back when filtering
the data source, leading to no match. How can I remedy this?

____

It 's basically a url `/search/123 456/` turning into `/search/123%20456/` and
failing to find the part.
