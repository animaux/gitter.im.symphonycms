@andrewminton not really; but I think there are also some ‘barcode’ fonts
which might turn out useful and less complex to use maybe.

__ __

guys anyone around still uses the Author Roles Extension? And any
functionality which is currently missing and/or replaced by other extensions?
- Had it installed on a client’s site without using it for a while and I’m
thinking of scrapping for something else (considering functionality they
requested) but I don’t know if it’s of any use as is.

Nice idea. Thanks Jon.. I've found a few php classes I can hook into on custom
events to generate what I need.

@jonmifsud I have used author roles recently.. But had to hack it a bit to
allow different show/hide features using js..

__ __

But it doesn't play well with members in the more recent version so I de
coupled that functionality to my needs.. I know the security issues in doing
that but its a small site without sensitive data so that was cool.

@andrewminton I’ve got a mix of extensions which do a bunch of things really.
hiding and showing elements I do through other extensions which I need to
start publishing.

Then I have some custom filtering going on, but looking for some functionality
whereby a group of users would have access to a ‘subset’ of entries which
people in their group publish

__ __

I wonder if somone would have some time to spec out what kind of features
you’re looking for. So I can see if I can convert whatever I have into
something more open source friendly

__ __

I think it might make sense for the sake of Symphony’s simplicity that things
are done into steps; with a lot of ‘tiny’ extensions taking care of different
components rather than 1 monster of an extension trying to do everything but
failing to do anything right...

My requirement is for the ability to have a group that are assigned their own
entries.. have the ability to edit their own entries. But if they are
added/invited to an entry by another user, they then have the ability to edit
that entry. I've done this using backend_scripts extension for now.

This is for a client records site so Author Roles isn't secure enough as is...
I can work with 2.7.0 if that's a minimum requirement yes.

as I didn’t really need to hide a bunch of sections rather just confirm if a
user had access to an entry or not, and hide linked items accordingly. in
between a delegate for publishFiltering + a select box Filtering delegate… I
got the job done. not sure if you did something for the relationship fields
you’re using

@nitriques can ERF pull in child section data with xmlimporter at all? I'm
migrating a site from firebase which s flat json database structure and need
to get relations over to master/child section in symphony.

Or do you know of a good way to ensure relationship from json is respected in
an import procedure?

Association can handle, if it's completely flat you might need to do some
magic like building related entries on the fly. Or searching for already
existing entries. Pretty sure same logic would apply for erf

that would be hard to do with the xml importer

__ __

you would need to first create the children, get their ids and then save the
parent

with a php script it would be easy

Ok thanks. It may be better to build an array of each entry using php and
import that way. I'm sure @michael-e has does some bulk command line imports
with related sections in the past that O recall him mentioning in the issue
tracker.. In relation to the log files I tjink it wasI'll see if I can dig
that out.

I have done some complicated imports, yes. But when it comes to relations, I
have only used the SBL field. The complicated imports were pure PHP scripts in
the end, without XML importer or other extensions.

I sticked rather closely to what Symphony does, using `checkPostData` and
`setDataFromPost`, for example. I will try to paste some code here…

__ __

    
    
    // Launch Symphony 2.6
    // Defines
    define('DOCROOT', realpath(rtrim(dirname(__FILE__) . '/../../../', '\\/')));
    // Include autoloader
    require_once DOCROOT . '/vendor/autoload.php';
    // Include the boot script
    require_once DOCROOT . '/symphony/lib/boot/bundle.php';
    // Begin Symphony proper
    ob_start();
    symphony('administration');
    // If XSRF protection is used, a session will have been generated.
    // Drop the useless session
    $_SESSION = array();
    cleanup_session_cookies();
    ob_end_clean();
    // Disable query logging (Re: memory issues, #2398)
    Symphony::Database()->disableLogging();
    
    
    // --------------------------------------------------
    // build your $data array here (that's the hard part)
    // --------------------------------------------------
    
    
    $author_id = 1;
    $section_id = 1;
    
    foreach ($data as $index => $fields) {
        $entry = EntryManager::create();
        $entry->set('author_id',  $author_id);
        $entry->set('section_id', $section_id);
    
        // do more stuff here?
    
        if (Entry::__ENTRY_FIELD_ERROR__ == $entry->checkPostData($fields, $errors)) {
            foreach ($errors as $field_id => $message) {
                echo 'ERROR  : entry ' . ($index + 1) . ' field ' . $field_id . ': ' . $message . "\n";
            }
            $count_errors ++;
        } else if (Entry::__ENTRY_OK__ != $entry->setDataFromPost($fields, $errors)) {
            foreach ($errors as $field_id => $message) {
                echo 'ERROR  : entry ' . ($index + 1) . ' field ' . $field_id . ': ' . $message . "\n";
            }
            $count_errors ++;
        } else if (!$entry->commit()) {
            echo 'ERROR  : entry ' . ($index + 1) . "\n";
            $count_errors ++;
        } else {
            Symphony::ExtensionManager()->notifyMembers('EntryPostEdit', '/publish/edit/', array(
                'section' => SectionManager::fetch($section_id),
                'entry' => $entry,
                'fields' => $fields
            ));
            echo 'Success: entry ' . ($index + 1) . "\n";
        }
    
        unset($errors);
    }

__ __

Three steps:

  * launch Symphony
  * build your data array
  * create the entries and commit them like Symphony would do

__ __

Note that I call only one delegate here, because I didn't need the others. You
may add them if you need them.

either that or else you can add a ‘custom’ function when filling up the
‘child’ entry

__ __

there I check using a ‘primary key’ or search for a name for example, to find
existing entries, if it does not exist I create it using the EntryManager
