@jonmifsud @nilshoerrmann I have found a relatively simple solution for the
recurring dates output problem with the Date & Time Fiels _as is_. If you’re
interested how, I can elaborate :)

@nitriques I have one new site and two current sites I am maintaining that I
want to port to Symphony. None of them are a rush and I can wait. Would it be
best to wait for 3.0 or go ahead now and build them in 2.6.7? How easily will
it be to migrate from 2.6.7 to 3.0?  
Many thanks!

My gut feeling would be to work with 2.6.x if it's something simple. If you
want to help debugging you can work on an integration branch

I’m making use of a node-set to transform the data the way I can conveniently
parse it into an HTML-calendar.

____

Simply grabbing all date-nodes and then get their corresponding parent event.

____

Then transform it into an event list only containing the date for the actual
event iteration.

____

Is that followable? :)

Yes – but I think it would be nice to have this documented publicly with code
examples :)

____

Would give you extra :clap: and :+1:

____

Could be an extra section in the readme

@animaux: Multi-step processing? Using EXSLTs node-set function?

:thumbsup:

____

Probably not particularly performant, but it’s not a lot of entries here.

____

@nilshoerrmann it has some quirks, since there are sub-events that can be
before and after the main-event. So I would have to simplifiy this. As always,
there little time at hand.

I wouldn't mind the performance drop in your case. In one of my projects I
have to parse 18.000 lines of HTML (around 1 MB) as a nodeset, and it takes
0.1 or 0.2 seconds extra.

In my case it’s `XSLT Transformation 0.0369 s`

____

Building of the XML takes 10× as long. Which might actually be a problem if it
was a longer list of events I guess.

Yep. XSLT is hardly ever the bottleneck.

@peterfleck_twitter Yup, you should start right now with 2.6.7 ! 3.0.0 might
break a couple of things, so I will take time to update all the ecosystem

@jonmifsud does the Association Output allows to use Cacheable datasource? I
don't get the 2nd datasource fields. Thx

@animaux so if i understand well your last words, having a lot of events on a
page can be a performance issue?
