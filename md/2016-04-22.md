@brendo nice to see you around :) got a quick question. I know you had started
using workspaces with a `section` directory to put section specific items. By
any chance did you have something written up on that? I can’t recall where
I’ve seen it. I currently use the same structure but for documentation
purposes / organising stuff for the community would be nice to re-use if
you’ve already created something.

@jonmifsud Nah I don't have anything written for it. It's a simple concept
though, a `sections` directory inside the `workspace` folder, with a file for
each of the sections in the admin. I then put the templates for any entries
inside that single file, I just found it helps keep things organised

@brendo agreed :) yeah couldn’t remember where I came across it if it was just
during a chat or if it was an article or something. I’ll take some time and
suggest it as a best-practice though. I’ve found the structure very useful.
Allows for re-using a bunch of templates without much changes (if any).

Yep, especially for common sections like resources, files or images

____

I find you can take the templates with you

oh yes most certainly. then I also use them for generic stuff like a mode
`link`

which is responsible of generating a link for any section. and I know that I
have a certain `set` which I can just call knowing that they work

____

then extend per section as needed.

It's utilities like those that really speed up development

____

I have something similar which automatically constructs links taking into
account the language and the entry hierarchy

Language haven’t used in a while for new projects but they’re pretty useful :)

____

yep they do; now we’re trying something akin to  @michael-e’s multi-site
setup. so I’ve added an additional `themes` directory into workspace. (all
content for now managed through symphony backend early stages)

____

If you’re still active with projects you might want to look into
<https://github.com/mazedigital/group_lock> it does some permission magic
using a section + linked associations. allowing automated backend filtering by
‘group’ and disabling people viewing/saving from one into the other (given
they don’t have permissions)
