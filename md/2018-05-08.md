Hi All,

As I mentioned previously, I have this `Request was rejected for having an
invalid cross-site request forgery token.` Issue when I try to log into
Symphony backend. Since I was not able to find out what's wrong with this, I
thought providing more details for what I have done so far.

I had a Symphony 2.6.x site on Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu 16.04) with PHP version
PHP 5.6 and MySql version 14.14 Distrib 5.7.22. I wanted to migrate this site
from this server to a new server particularly having following server setup.

Apache/2.4.18  
Ubuntu 16.04  
PHP 7.0.28  
MySql Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.7.22

After migrating the site I've updated Symphony to the latest version (2.7.6).
The update and all went fine except that I was not able to log into the
Symphony backend. Once I enter my credentials and log in, I get the following
error =>

`Request was rejected for having an invalid cross-site request forgery token.

Please go back and try again.`

What I have tried already

1 - Cleared the browser cache/cookies including browsing history.  
2 - Cleared file cache and DB cache  
3 - Disabled xsrf in the config (then when I log in, it redirects back to the
login)

A one special case I forgot to mention previously is that the current site is
running on HTTPS and migrated one is working on HTTP(I don't think this is
related to the issue). Please help me to resolve this issue.

Thanks

Or integrated Google calendar with Symphony?

Sorry no.

Has anyone built a custom DS that simply lists the contents of a folder in the
`workspace`?
