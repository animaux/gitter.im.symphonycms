Is there anyone around with a gitter pro-account who is able to suck this
whole thread down right from the start?

____

It’s hard enough to keep track after 2 weeks of holidays. And there are so
many interesting things lost in this endless dialogue … even if this is really
nice in terms of quick response — it is really a step backwards in terms of
documentation.

____

Therefore it would be great to have a dump of everything which is actually
searchable.

<https://gitter.im/symphonycms/symphony-2/archives/> could be used to grab
everything with a bot

____

for  @nitriques to debug at one point. Github noticed that the same key used
there is now on github so it’s a self-security feature
