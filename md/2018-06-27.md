@jonmifsud are you around? I’m having a DB-issue with `association_field` and
`MariaDB 10.1`

@michael-e will a simple update from `ETM 5.1` to `current` break stuff?

It should not. But please be careful. Make a backup. :-)

And please note that for  "optional attachments" to work, you will need
Symphony 2.7. The feature won't have any effect in Symphony 2.6.

Yes, that sounds reasonable, because I never used it on PHP 7.2 :-) Please
send a PR if possible!
