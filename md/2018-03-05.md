I’m baffled right now.. is there someone who directly uses the
`EntryManager::fetch` function?

____

I have an instance where in a specific circumstance I do

`var_dump($entry_id); var_dump(EntryManager::fetch($entry_id ));die;`

No entry is reportedly found.. yet I can find the entry if I go to the URL; if
I re-run the same script it works. The difference is something is being
created on a third-party service the first run as it doesn’t exist before.

I get a fairly consistent behaviour but I don’t understand why the fetch
function goes awol...

My issue seems to be

`ND (`ed`.`start` = ( SELECT MAX(`m`.`start`) FROM `sym_entries_data_108`AS
`m` WHERE `m`.`entry_id` = `e`.`id` AND 1=1 GROUP BY `m`.`entry_id` LIMIT 1 )`
@nitriques is this a potential bug you are aware of / is being fixed?

FYI that’s a where/join clause which I’m not passing (set to null when I call
the function ) that seems to be sticking... I’ll keep digging but can’t quite
find what the apparent issue is.

@nitriques figured it out (though not sure why its joining to this specific
table) > I was passing entry_id as a string; I don’t think this was ever an
issue before… or at least not something I was consiously aware of; then it was
adding the sorting function.

@jonmifsud yeah type should never be an issue. I see this is a date field, and
I would expect the bug to be there, not in the core

____

I use the EntryManager directly very often

____

And I CAN 'T WAIT to deprecate fetch in 3.0.0

;) it is a mix of the date field and the fetch method that sucks SO hard

I changed from `is_int` to `is_numeric` and works wonders. but not sure its
the correct thing to fix

yeah the funny thing the default sort I think is trying to sort against a
field which was not in the section

yep I think that was part of the problem; I’m guessting sort preferences were
not updated elsewhere because there was an integer or something but still
tried to join on the default (of a previous entry/section) recipe for disaster

____

though it was my first time coming across it and my code is littered with
`fetch` entry stuff

____

would you mind first testing if `General::intval($entry_id) > 0` yeilds ?

____

`is_numeric` supports negative and decimals
