@jonmifsud is there a repo for it? I can test locally if you need someone?

@andrewminton that would be nice - there’s a `set` of things you’d need to do.
basically a couple of extension updates (to test versions) + a new extension

____

  1. Set Association Field to this repo/branch > <https://github.com/mazedigital/association_field/tree/association_filters>

  2. Set the Association UI Selector to this repo/branch > <https://github.com/mazedigital/association_ui_selector/tree/filters>

  3. Add new conditional field extension > <https://github.com/mazedigital/conditional_fields>

That should be the right combination to get this working. The Conditional
Fields extension has some important info you need to read on the local
setup/configuration.
