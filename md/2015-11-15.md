I'm currently experimenting with angular for the first time but I am following
the tutorial and then adding the extra challenge of making it work in symphony

The attribute has no value, you should try `<div ng-view="ng-view"></div>` (or
any other value).

@michael-e beat me to it in xslt each attribute requires a value otherwise
it's invalid and the processor throws an error

Hi maybe you'd like to help me again, I have created a symphony page that
outputs only JSON based of a Todo datasource. In my angularjs services.js the
code is referring to a .json file. Is it possible to load the JSON created by
symphony here? I know it's a not a symphony-only question but I am hoping you
can answer.

`phonecatServices.factory('Phone', ['$resource', function($resource){ return
$resource('angular-phonecat/app/phones/:phoneId.json', {}, { query:
{method:'GET', params:{phoneId:'phones'}, isArray:true} }); }]);`

____

Is the code that I 've got from the angular tutorial

Sorry, I have never worked with angular.js. But you should be able to read a
JSON page no matter what the file suffix is. (Symphony pages don't have
suffixes, normally. But you could also define rewrite rules in your .htaccess
file if you want to use a suffix.)

oh I was mistaken, it actually does load the JSON from that page. The :
phoneId.json part refers to the individual JSON file containing more info
about a product

alright it's progressing well.. I'm gonna make a Todo list that shows on the
top of the page, that is fed JSON data made from a symphony datasource
