@wdebusschere: I have no idea why this happens, I don't use Frontend
Localisation. You will have to debug the issue by checking everything
systematically. (POST data, session in the database and so on.)

Default, just a contact form. First I thought it was due to cachelite and
disabled it and clear cache

> I got an empty `<events />` in `?debug`

This is normal behaviour, unless you append `?debug` directly your form action
and have no redirect at all when loading the target page.
