@nitriques @nilshoerrmann @brendo Is this _unfinished_ superficial redesign of
the backend something I should move forward with?

That’s why I added _unfinished_ :·)

____

Anyway, I guess it’s a long way to go to make everyone happy, so I might be
better off putting it in an extension …

____

A lot more nice user interaction stuff would be possible if one changed the
markup plus JS too. I just don’t see enough time coming …

yeah I think an extension would be best.

I’m baffled by how much styling is needed for the backend … so many different
possibilities, states, etc.

hello anyone here to help with a 404 error with jit? All rights on directories
seems to be ok. But jit is not making the cache files

Does anybody have a defined workflow (and maybe some code) to ensure that
changes of a Member's email address are "validated" (so, some sort of "de-
activating" the Member first, sending a confirmation email etc.). I am just
thinking about this…

Well, ok, thanks. Meanwhile I think that I need s.th. very special anyway. :-)
But I can keep you informed about my findings if you like.
