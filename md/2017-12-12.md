Is anyone using
<http://symphonyextensions.com/extensions/entry_relationship_field/> apart
from @nitriques himself? It looks very interesting, would love to see some
examples of it in use.

@animaux it is SO tailored for our needs, I do not think it is very popular

____

and our doc is not very good

____

But is you feel like trying it, I could make myself available to help. And try
to improve the docs in the meantime

We need to filter a datasource based on cookies (dropdown choices are
remembered in cookies and not in urlparameters), it this a stable concept?

@nitriques maybe we have the same needs `:)` Will have a look at it as soon as
I find the time!

____

@wdebusschere I have a site where I filter by cookies using the storage
extension. That works.

I think there were some pitfalls though regarding updating the values. Not
sure if that’s a problem in your case.

Just had a look. Storage has it’s own DS.

____

Hmm, looks like I am not actually filtering by storage output.

____

Rather using a full output from which I grab the entries I need via XSL/XPATH.
Rather ugly solution.

____

I reckon it shouldn’t be hard to customize the Storage DS in order to output
params.

Ah, there’s an option for that! It was just not visible because of a bug in
the old version I had in use. Brilliant. Page creation time just dropped from
~ 0.9 to 0.1s! Yeah!
