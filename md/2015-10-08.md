QUICK QUESTION: I have a project where I can ONLY use a Rich Text Editor.
Which one do y'all use with the latest versions of Symphony? Doesn't look like
Redactor is kept up with. CKEditor is a beast loads all over the place... have
tons of issues with it. If y'all are using one of those, is there a branch or
one that is being kept up with.

@jonmifsud \- I am huge fan myself, have some staff that on an old project
that refuse to use Markdown and am trying to keep them happy with a Rich Text
Editor.

It 's just that all of the rich text editors on Symphony CMS... seem to not
work well on current versions of Symphony CMS.

Yeah I added some UI but it's still vanilla markdown
