@nitriques I think it’s a location thing. The bar became in force with an EU
rule/law. not sure if there’s the same thing in Canada

no we don't: but does this means EU users of my sites can "tell on me" ?

good question, I’m not sure if it depends where you are based, but I assume if
you are specifically serving those customers it’s safer to be coevered at
least in T&C

____

usually the way the law is (or my understanding of it) is that you if you are
in breach they let you know and give you a period within which you have to be
compliant.

O ok that's good. I'll wait and see then, because I am pretty sure that my
clients 1.) do not give a shit 2.) do not want any of those warning on their
site. But for our properties, I think I'll add a thing in our T&C

thanks

Mind you realistically this measure is unenforcable. Imagine they had to
contact each and every website and check them periodically.

But being  "pollitically correct" is a trust factor on the web

very true :) at the same time anyone who lives in the world and believes that
they cannot be tracked, cookies or otherwise is living in the clouds… (even
there they might be tracked)

Sorry guys wasn't around today, my understanding here is that the EU will fine
your government (UK for me) if they don't be seen to enforce the policy. So in
turn the UK government will threaten to hand out fines to the companies if
they didn't comply. I don't think they can pick on you in Canada if you're own
government doesn't have to comply.

____

I mean because UK is being part of the EU.

I cloned myself earlier, they don't know which me has the real advertising
preferences. If I can clone myself 256 times they'll never break the code :)
