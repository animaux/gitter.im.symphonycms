Anybody interested in how we use symphony to build websites and web
applications?  
Take a look at our cms build on top of symphony, the cms allows the developer
to add widgets to a page (block, form, map, gallery) and on the frontend our
designer builds then the different widgets in xsl :)

Mostly clients don't touch the widgets, like a news grid widget, we build the
site with widgets for them, after they can manage section data in the cms

I guess my primary use case for widgets is for specific projects where weâ€™d
like clients to manage page data with some extra flexibility. and/or design
components which with Symphony backend becomes somewhat harder to do unless we
do markdown pre-fill shortcuts

Looks very good, @wdebusschere. Am I correct in thinking /cms/ is a pseudo-
back-end layer of the front-end using Symphony Events?

@diomed the frontend doesn't have the itemswidget.., we usually replace items
according to the client needs.. can be services, products, teammembers,..
