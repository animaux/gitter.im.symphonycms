@twiro very good, thansk for this. I’d be happy with it. The one thing you
mention with a question mark is the getsymphony.com extensions section. I feel
this should really be merged with symphonyextensions.com, or archived and
deactivated in some way, since there is a lot of probably useful legacy stuff
in there. Doesn’t look like @nitriques will have the time to do that
currently.

Thats what I think too - symphonyextensions.com is the far more useful, active
and up-to-date solution. There are currently 373 extension on
symphonyextensions.com and 435 on getsymphony.com - it would be nice to set up
a comparison and have a look at the stuff that's not on
symphponyextensions.com - I guess most will be quite old and of not much use
today... maybe one could figure out a good idea what to do with the stuff that
might be of use - transfer it, archive it... well - but as I'm not a huge fan
of these chatlike-all-in-one-timeline-discussions I'm simply gonna set up a
separate issue over on github regarding that question ;)
