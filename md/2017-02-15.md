Hello. I've just used `git checkout --track origin/bundle` on a fresh
installation but the `/install/` says "This script will update your existing
Symphony installation to version 2.6.9." I was expecting 2.6.11.

I'm not Git-savvy. What are the future implications of committing the changes
(`.gitmodules` and a couple of `submodule add`s) to fetch/merge with
`origin/master`?
