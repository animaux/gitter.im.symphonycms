@jonmifsud Very nice! I’ve never came across Group Lock before.

Is there an out-of-the-box-way to change an entry if a page is loaded?

____

For example check a checkbox in an entry if a page is loaded.

Depending on what you want to do an event or extension delegate would be good

Are there any examples for such events flying around? Like »check a checkbox
in an entry if a page is loaded«.

I don’t happen to have one handy… are you showing a notice on the page and
want to confirm it has been seen?

> XSLT is one of those things (like let's say `make` or `awk`) that seems
totally wack, until it flashes. It may take a while. But I would never go back
to anything else

It flashed!

`apply-templates` has been the most frustrating instruction in my computer
career

@Manaus I thought that, and then I realised that, in some cases, `for-each`
will suffice :smile:

Yes `for-each` came in easy, but it was a partial knowledge, makes one feel
awkward

haha. I sometimes feel like re-writing code some of our interns/staff do… I
literally detest having for-each loops… apply templates is so much neater. And
the magic possible is incredible.

Even a REGEX Master Expert would have problems doing what we do with XSLT
transformation on pre-processed HTML[markdown] so easy.

Even for small code segments which will never be repeated and do not require
parameters? I find it sometimes reduces the need for `if` conditionals which
only repeat the same select query

If I have conditionals with repeats as you mention its likely an opportunity
to have a clean cut apply templates with separate template modes each. I have
staff which use for-each… when I find them and have time I de-construct every
time.

Also if you are looping on a separate item from a separate section - it 100%
needs to be split. I prefer to work that each file contains stuff relating to
only 1 section. When it touches multiple sections it needs to be split up into
templates. Usually if you need a for-each you’re dealing with another section;
hence needs a split.

Hey @jonmifsud how goes it in Malta?

____

Need some advice on Date Range filtering if anyone has experience the the
Date/Time field? I have an alerts section that I 'd like to display on the
front of the site. I only want the alerts to appear based on a date range but
struggling to figure out the datasource filter to only show the alert between
certain dates. thoughts? Ive tried the equal to or later than today but that
doesn't do all I want it to.
