There is <https://github.com/klaftertief-symphony/imagecropper>, which is
unmaintained for 6 years.

You could try if one of the forks works in current symphony versions:
<https://github.com/klaftertief-symphony/imagecropper/network>, but I guess
they will need some work too.

Ooh. Sounds good. Thanks for your hard work, @nitriques. Will there be a
seamless upgrade path from 2.7.7 to 3.0.0?

@nitriques Super! You reference an [extension compatibility
table](https://www.getsymphony.com/download/extensions/compatibility/) I've
not seen before. This one looks nicer <http://symphonyextensions.com/matrix/>
Which is canon, or are they both pulling the same data?

@cylkee It's the same data: if there are differences, it may by a cache issue

____

@animaux Please, never do that ;)
