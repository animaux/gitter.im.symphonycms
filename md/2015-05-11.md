Hey @michael-e :) Just looking to package up 2.6.x as 2.6.2

Hey @brendo, that's cool. I really like 2.6.x, using it in "the next big
project".

Ah, no. I am using the 2.6.x branch, because the thingie is in production
already. The databse logging stuff really helped me with big data imports. I
am using PHP scripts in the CLI for that.

When this is finished (still some features missing), I will try and update the
first big project. I will probably try the integration branch then. It might
just be that I find some hiccups. :-)

____

I just rebased on 2.6.x, and I have only 3 additional hacks in my Symphony
version! That is not too many.

____

FYI, here are my additional hacks:

  * Always create an XSRF token in the frontend.
  * Remove handles for parameters. Fixes #2332
  * Input field: Clean data. (See [discussion](https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/issues/2369#issuecomment-99683411))

the moment.

You may have a hard time merging 2.6.x and integration in the end, especially
because of the PDO rewrite.
