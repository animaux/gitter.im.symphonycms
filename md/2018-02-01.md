lots of people contributed for 2.7.1! But since the github handle do not
always match the website username, some of them are missing :(

Also, you can track the `lts` and `lts-bundle` branches
<https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/tree/lts>
<https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/tree/lts-bundle> for future
releases of the lts versions, I've updated them
