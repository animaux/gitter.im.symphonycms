@nitriques and others. Shall we get started with deactivating the New User
form on symphonycms.com and replace it with a text saying you should ask for
an account here in the gitter chat? I could do that.

Regarding the `association_field`-problems I mentioned above … I was still
working with the `1.0.1` version from @jonmifsud’s fork :rage4:

____

Didn’t see there was a `2.0.2` with the symphonists account. _cough_

@jonmifsud Do I get this right that by this I could have an association field
that only finds entries matching a certain citeria? —>

`2.0.2` is also not solving the problem I mentioned above :(

configuration on the fly. What are you trying to achieve?

I thought the result limit (default: 20) was limiting the search results.
Apparently it prevents entries from being found at all.

____

I’m linking to a section with people data. Name, Bith date, profession, etc.

I want to be able to show only entries with `profession=photographer`

I had tried to bake that into the core but realised it was pointless.. so I
got an extension which works without an interface… just json options

____

<https://github.com/mazedigital/conditional_fields>

____

have a look through that see if it makes sense. The setup should also allow
for multiple options. ie when a user adjusts a dropdown - your association
filter options update

make it work properly with the AI Selector Interface. That was not the case
earlier I think.

do you have any unusual console errors?

seems like it is only showing data from the initial load (20) and not running

Might be a problem with my fork of the selector though, but at least that
hasn’t changed.

____

That’s what it looks like, yes.

____

No errors.

____

I think the problem first came up after updating from a `2.7.x` beta or RC to
the final `2.7.0` or the current `2.7.x` branch. Suddenly a client was not
able to find some entries.

@michael is it possible that a `members:password` field does not throw an
error in a frontend form if it empty. Even though it is set to »required«.

____

Is that possibly due to the behaviour that you can keep a current pw if you
leave the fields empty?

____

OK, apparently that was because of the `members:update password` event
attached.
