Hope so to. I have friends who still plan to go to Brussels later today, these
things can't stop us from moving forward

Is there a way to group by a tag list? I have a "Part Category" that is a tag
list and I want a data source to get the distinct categories in order to
generate a list of links to filter by category but "Part Category" isn't
showing up in the group by drop-down on the data source admin page.

Unique tags would probably be best obtained through other methods; grouping
all articles/entries by tags seems like an overkill if that’s what you want to
use it for.

I would usually take the datasource and customise it making a query right from
the database. But not sure what your level of php/sql is like

Ah, I didn't know that was possible. I'll look into it.

if you want do try that out what you’d do is

__ __

  1. find the datasource you want to edit in the workspace/datasources.
  2. set the ‘editable’ to return `false` so you don’t overwrite it by mistake
  3. edit the `execute` function
    * you can call the database using `Symphony::Database()->fetch(“Query Here”);`
    * make sure you return valid XML, look at the XML Element API or generate it as a string.

I’m about to head off but if you need some help with that I’ll check it out
tomorrow.

Not sure if y'all remember me but I was the guy from a couple of weeks ago who
learned Symphony when I was supposed to be learning Symfony thanks to them
being pronounced the same. I ended up rebuilding my parents' business website
again that weekend in Symfony and was able to walk through the code and
explain it during my interview and ended up getting the job. I'm still using
Symphony for my parents' website though so I don't have to make my own admin
panel. :P
