hey @nitriques I had a quick question ...

____

We’re doing some multilingual, but can’t get frontend-localization
<https://github.com/DeuxHuitHuit/frontend_localisation> to recognize the
region

____

<https://github.com/klaftertief/language_redirect> will recognize the region
and lang, but will not _set_ the language in  <fl-language>

____

any tips on how to proceed?

Anyone know of a way to lock certain fields from being edited once the entry
is created? is backend scripts the only way to do it? Trying to think of a way
to lock the input field of a certain section once the entry has been created
so that users can't amend the contents..
