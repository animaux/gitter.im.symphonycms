For anyone who uses the Association Field: I’ve got a new PR
symphonists/association_field#23

Would be nice if someone other than myself gets to try it out and see if it’s
as useful as I think it might be.

like usual. if you’re doing a datasource and you want a regexp; use this
syntax:

    
    
    related: regexp: {$your-param}

____

not sure if that makes sense

Ahh, so the change is all about the DS. Thought it was for the interface in
the backend …

I was referring to filtering the results in DS and filtering options from the
top.

____

what you want is to enable a subset of results.
