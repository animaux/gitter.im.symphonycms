         $div = new XMLElement("div", $author_id, array(

____

It displays my author_id but how do I put more vars in like the name. Do you
have to build the string first?

Do you have an idea of the markup you’d like to create?

____

That information will be available to you in the Author object,
<http://www.getsymphony.com/learn/api/2.6.1/toolkit/author/>

____

And then it’s a case of using XMLElement to add the various bits

____

By default, what you have above will just set the content of the div to the be
the ID

Sorry I'm stuck with the way to add things to the displayPublishPanel and I'm
confused about adding more stuff into the div I'm creating here. I have this
bit

     $wrapper->appendChild($div);

Yep, so that’s going to attach the <div> element to the wrapper for your field

____

That’s something that Symphony auto generates for you

____

If you want to put more things in the div, then you can do so like:

`$div->appendChild(new XMLElement(‘p’, ‘Hello World’));`

Think of XMLElement like jQuery

just with an ugly syntax :P

I want to store author_id and author_username in tbl_entries_xx it's expecting
entry_id and value when I try to publish an entry. Or rather I created the
fields in the table ok but it's looking for a value field.

That’s no worries

____

You’ll need to provide your own processRawFieldData function

____

This is going to be called when the entry is saved and what is returns is an
associative array where the key is the column name and the value is the value
you want to save

Cheers both of you, was just staring at processRawFieldData in the API docs.
Value had confused me because I was thinking it was the name of a field.

____

Tracker looks great but I 'm on the final part of saving data to my table so
I'm carrying on digging :)

As far as I read it is indeed. For the websites I make search is mostly an
overkill.

@brendo sorry just woke up here :) wouldn’t mind adding another client to the
list. re ElasticSearch I’ve prepared one but never actually got it released -
but planning to use it eventually.

but selectize filters the autocomplete results

____

so the two are different, even if symphony returns results it doesn’t show
them. Figure other people might be having issues too

not that I could spot. - I fixed it by adding an additional value in their
Diactitics object. but not sure that would be the best way to fix it.
