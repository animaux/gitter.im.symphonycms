Hey guys, does anyone know, if there is a way to send an array of values from
the front-end to a tag list field? It seems like the field only accepts a
single string (as in the backend) although the _output_ on the front-end is
always an array of XML `items`.

I do not think it can accept array. Can you implode it ?

Using JavaScript before posting, yes.

____

The thing is, I’d expect the field to accept both string and array values: the
XML output offers both (array in the XML, string in the parameter pool), the
backend does not.

____

Would a change (allowing both) be acceptable as pull request?

That's another reason why we need to separate does two concerns

____

If it 's backward compatible, not a problem

Okay, I think that should be possible

____

If I’m not mistaken, only these two lines would have to be wrapped in a
conditional checking for a string/array value:
<https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/blob/master/symphony/lib/toolkit/fields/field.taglist.php#L400>
\+
<https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/blob/master/symphony/lib/toolkit/fields/field.taglist.php#L419>

____

So that the field only converts to an array, if it’s not already given an
array
