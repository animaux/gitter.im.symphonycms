@munki-boy Yeah thatâ€™s probably the browser cache clearing out the old CSS
files?

Quick question... is it possible to do a regex pattern on a sort in your
datasource? For instance, I would like to sort a list of numbers... that are
in text... John 1, John 2, John 3, John 10, John 11, John 12.

Basically, my problem, is that it is sorting like so... John 1, John 10, John
11, John 12, John 2, John 3... and I would like for it to sort from the
datasource like so... John 1, John 2, John 3, John 10, John 11, John 12

... Is that possible to do in a datasource... also... this John 1, John 2
values are coming from a datasource
