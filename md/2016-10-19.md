Is there a roadmap version for bundling Association Field with Symphony, and
will it be possible to convert from existing SBL fields/data?

one question

__ __

having an association field let's say **Product**

__ __

can i have a _reflection_ of it's fields like **{entry/product/description}**
?

__ __

i'm creating a utility for this reflection .. and i'm wondering if that entry
(the association field) it's available with all it's fields
