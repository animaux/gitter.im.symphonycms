Geolocation question for you all: What do you find the best way of showing
localised content? I.e I'm in New Zealand and a site shows me NZ conten. In
Australia, they see AU content on the same URL. Majority of people probably
change up the url, so it's example.com/nz,
[example.com/au](http://example.com/au) etc ? What I'm wondering is how well
Google indexes sites with locale-aware crawling. So the exact same URL
structure, but based on the IP it shows different content. Does Google AU
crawl AU content effectively? Or is it not effective and use the US crawlbot
more than it should?

@nitriques many thanks! Will have a look at it.

____

@pixelninja not that I really know, but I’d think Google would be more aware
of language than location. So if you properly tag your content too (e. g.
`<body lang="en-NZ">` I’d think Google should be aware of that.

____

Haha, body-language *chuckle*.

Yea in 2015 Google started using crawlbots with IPs other than from the USA,
to make sure sites with locale aware content were crawled. But a lot of people
had issues with indexing, as the crawlbots weren't coming from the right
countries, or there were no crawlbots for their country at all. Surely they've
gotten better in 2 years...

@nimanthaharshana Since the DS is bound to a page, I’d think you would have to
create a source page for your Ajax request and let that handle the filtering
via page params or url-params.

@wdebusschere and @animaux Thank you very much, but if I send it as a GET var,
should I include it as => {$url-myParamName} ? also can I send POST vars and
filter ?

____

Actually I 'm trying to filter my members section through a parameter (by
sending Email)

I have a DS attached to a page which I send the AJAX request (Say my page is
named AJAX and my DS is attached to the page). With my AJAX request I'm
sending a parameter( member email). What I need is to filter the DS with
email. So how can I send the parameters (Should it be a GET parameter always
?). If it's possible to send the parameter as a POST parameter, how can I
specify that parameter in the Symphony backend ? In case of GET request how
can I specify the filtering in Symphony backend ?

And do you want to display this info on your page? Or just in the mail?

____

You could just post a form with the member-id and then add the datasource to
the mailtemplate and filter by $etm-entry-id

____

no need for ajax

Sorry, I think you have mistaken. I'm sending Email address as data via an
AJAX request. In the page where I send my AJAX request there's a DS attached.
I want that DS to filter the members with the Email address I sent, so that I
can have all the corresponding member info back.

____

So I have questions like,  
1) how to send request data  
2) how to add the filtering param in the DS

we send a GET request. I wonder if there's any way of sending a POST request
and filter the DS. Anyway thank you very much !! :-)

Sorry, another question. I have member registrations within the site, so when
a new user get registered on the site, an Email will be sent to activate the
account. Say if by any chance user didn't receive the activation email, I want
to resend the email. What would be the easiest way of doing this ?

If you look at [the Big Picture](https://github.com/symphonycms/members/wiki
/The-Big-Picture), you will see that you can create a special "resend
activation code" page, with the "Regenerate Activation Code" Members event. I
usually add a link to that page below the login form, with a short text ("You
need to be activated to login. If you haven't received the email with the
activation code, you can [request a new code](http://#page)").

For those of you who do use localised pages, how do you set up each country?
e.g [example.com/au/](http://example.com/au/) and example.com/nz/. In Symphony
Pages, do I need to create those 2 base pages and then create 2 of every page
after that? So 2 about pages, 1 as a child of each country page. Or is there a
better way to prevent duplicating pages?
