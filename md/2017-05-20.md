of paragraphs to show on main page to encourage people to click on whole
articles.

uhm, it didn't really help me

____

wordpress has the excerpt thing, how do I incorporate this stuff there? I know
that I have to play with get-article.xsl, the part homepage-article/entry and
add code there, but I have no idea how to limit the paragraphs shown
