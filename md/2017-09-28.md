Is this spam? I would think it is. In case it is, it’s a very good content
generator used here:

It seems to take parts of the posts before and rearranges them grammtically
correct and it even seems to google related stuff.

@animaux we use Paypal, Worldpay and GoCardless (direct debits) with Symphony.
All of these use a version of the [Paypal Payments
Extension](http://symphonyextensions.com/extensions/paypal_payments/) to
process payment notifications and update Symphony records accordingly. We're
about to start a Stripe integration, though we don't have a shape for it as
yet.

@nitriques, can you please approve the Pull request from @animaux for the HTML

@animaux that was spam for sure, considering it was a new registration and
replying to an older post. NB last week I deleted something like 50 spam
posts. I am still thinking if its pure bots or also some folks involved.

@jurajkapsz I often wonder that too. Weird … @nitriques is keen to shut the
whole forum down `:)`

@nitriques you wont forget `2.7.1`, will you? `;)`

@animaux I think the forum is fine, lots of valuable info, though I find it
tough to search there.

@animaux I am waiting for reviews on this PR: symphonycms/symphony-2#2762

____

@animaux I think the only thing we should put down would be registration...
Like "ask for an account on the chat" ?

@jurajkapsz @animaux Better yet, you can go one, perhaps two, directories
deep: `site:getsymphony.com/discuss searchterm`
