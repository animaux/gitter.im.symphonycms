hmm odd

____

you never need to find things ‘in reverse’?

____

say if you link an entry to anotherone - you are never in the ‘second entry’
and want to figure out which is the other linked entry?

yeah I find it very useful - the table entries in index doesn’t work for me

____

sometimes I have 5+ different relationships

____

so all you see are numbers which don’t make much sense in the index view
