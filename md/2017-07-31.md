it depends what you want to achieve

____

if they are not editable; and you’re fine with building custom datasources
importing as SQL assuming they’re set up efficiently could be an easy option.
Otherwise if you want symphony section I’d say XML with the XML Importer

@jonmifsud They just need to be published like if someone search john 1:1-2 it
will publish on screen thats it no need to be editable.

I’d be tempted to keep the database the same (just to simplify importing) but
you’d need to mimic the current database queries via a datasource. If you know
how to handle that with php I’d say go that way

@animaux Indeed. If you had RC1 insalled, you do not need to run the
installer: just change the version in the config.php file

@jonmifsud @pixelninja I'd love to go, but tickets to Malta cost 2000$ :(

____

Australia would be even more!

____

I came down for around $600 or 700 I think…

we’d find a low-season which would get better pricing

pretty much… we’d be unlucky if it turns out a really bad week weekend.

____

I’d say November/October or March-May might be the best combinations for
prices.

if you think that works; let me know the best periods (or I do a poll) and I
start looking at options. and dates

Then depending if the community is picky for accomodation I might even try to
find a venue used by my local volunteering organisation which gives a really
good nightly rate (but it’s not exactly a hotel) I believe last quote we got
was around €23/night - or I can give a few options

I don’t know if they treat me differently if I approach them as a business but
last we had an EU funded project that’s what we where given. keep me posted
and then I guess we can structure on the feedback I get :)

If we make it in Malta, I would try and append some holiday. I'd prefer a good
hotel then. :-)

yep I can mix both in no problem :) but for those who say it could be
expensive we can look at options

hi guys. I changed some data sources that use the Remote Datasource extension
from a full url to a dynamic using {$root}/workspace/.... as the URL. The
cache has stopped working by making this change.  
Is that coincidence, a bug or something wrong with my data source file? Is
there a way to test which it is?  
Thanks.
