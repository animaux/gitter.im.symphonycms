Iâ€™ve started working on Symphony `2.1.x`however I have also worked on projects
which were build in Symphony `2.0 (alpha/beta)` and the old/original Symphony
3 AKA Symphony BBC

Hey all, hope all is well? busy thread this one!

Wondered if anyone had a snippet of info for me with regards to posting to the
rest_api extension from react native? looking to create entries from an app
and populate the symphony backend using rest api. Struggling with formatting
the post data at present. anyone have any experience with the correct
formatting around multidimensional json array around the whole fields[
'fieldname'] value pairs?

Figured it out. sending the data as a string like the get request, but in the
body of the POST request works. i.e.
data=fields[name]=andrew&fields[email][=me@mintypoohs.com](mailto:=me@mintypoohs.com)
We're in business woop woop!
