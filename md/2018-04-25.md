@jonmifsud good to hear the association field has a future, let me know once
you are starting to work on that.

@animaux \- if it didn’t have a future all my big projects would go down the
drain or end-up on a legacy version… PDO on its own is enough reason to make
sure they’re updated.

@nitriques I’m going to have a closer look at the docs soon. Not sure I’m up

@nitriques so essentially you’re saying what you need is more testing and
finding out bugs. Great.

@nitriques I wanted to add an extension to symphonyextensions.com. But I saw
that the site asks for permission to **read and write all user data**. So I
didn 't log in. Do you think this is something that might be easily changed
(so it only asks for read permissions)?

@animaux What's the difference between Select Box Link Field and Association
Field? I see Association Field is forked from Select Box Link Field.

At the core they are the same. However Association Field has some really good
UI drawers + is also powered by Ajax. The Select Box Link Field wouldn’t
manage to handle the hundreds/thousands of entries within a linked section in
terms of UI

@jonmifsud To transition from SBL to AF, is it a straight swap, or is there
pain? [Docs](http://symphonyextensions.com/extensions/association_field/) are
a little... slim.

straight forward swap. Just some database changes (manual) to chagne the field
type

Ignore me. I was thinking of the long-depreciated subsection manager.

Essentially if I recall it’s changing field type on the extensions table and
cloning the values from sbl to association field table

> Ignore me. I was thinking of the long-depreciated subsection manager.

The process is quite similiar to that. It’s hidden somewhere … I don’t think
you needed to clone anything. Just rename all fields and swap an ID or
something along the lines of that …

Thanks  @nitriques ;)
