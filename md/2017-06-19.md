Hmn, grunt fails if I try to use it in the RC release-zip.

Is it correct that Symphony 2.7 is compatible with PHP 7?

@nitriques @jonmifsud Is it really as simple as changing the field type in the
DB? Using phpMyAdmin? I have some core Text Input fields I'd like to convert
to Number Field.

In this context: how "semantic" is the versioning? Is Symphony 2.7 a drop-in
version where everything is supposed to work as before or are there breaking
changes we should be aware of?

I think that this should work. Using PHP7 will, however, depend on the
extensions.

____

That said, I wouldn 't use it on a production site until it's released
finally. I found one or two bugs yesterday.

@nilshoerrmann I’ve been using the beta quite heavily recently with now
showstoppers so far. All the smaller problems I had are fixed with minor
extension updates.

@cylkee there might be a couple of queries involved but yes shouldn't be too
hard to do

@iotsci I would then try to contact their support to see what generating that
