Hi guys, I'm having an issue I can't wrap my head around: I'm using SMTP for
sending e-mails, works great when my site runs on localhost, but on production
server I'm getting 'Connection refused' error returned from Symphony smtp
class. The sysadmin of that SMTP server told me, that he can see me in logs
connecting from my localhost, but he does not see anything coming from
production server. Is this some production server PHP or server setting issue?
Never had this before, though I usually use the default Sendmail method, which
I can't in this case. I'm using Symphony v2.6.11 with PHP v5.6.x. Thanks for
any tips.

@jurajkapsz I would suggest you try on your server with a simple php
mailscript with smtp

OK, a simple smtp script does the same, it does not connect, returning
connection refused. I will check that with the provider / sysadmin

Maybe a telnet can give you more info

Maybe port 25 is closed. Some providers do this by default. Yes, you could
check using telnet!

I guess that would require a shell on remote server, or not? I don't have
shell access

Doing telnet from my localhost connects successfully

____

Yes, it will be something with ports

Yep, it requires a shell. So it's probably best to ask the provider.
