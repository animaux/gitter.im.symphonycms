Hi all. I am trying to populate the value of an input field with a value
using:

    
    
    <input  value="{role}" />

Where role is coming from the page XML. However, some entries have encoded
apostrophes. E.g "stuart's"

Normally I would be able to escape these using

    
    
    <xsl:value-of select="role" disable-output-escaping="yes" />

However, since I am using the curly bracket syntax to insert the value in an
input field, I can't. Can anyone suggest a way to fix this without using a
separate XSL variable such as:

    
    
    <xsl:variable name="newrole">
    <xsl:value-of select="role" disable-output-escaping="yes" />
    </xsl:variable> 
    <input  value="{$newrole}" />

There are loads of instances of this field on the page, and the latter fix
seems very long-winded. THANKS

Can role be CDATA beforehand?
