@animaux Sometimes disabling and re-enablinhg the JIT extension seems to fix
it - especially when moving between versions. You may have already tried that
though.

@stuartgpalmer yeah that could have helped since it edits the .htaccess. But
@animaux's problem was just wrong files

What's the best way to disable members from logging on with the members
extension? We gave the members section a checkbox field with the name active.
And filter our member datasource with active=yes, but they are logged in.

can you try to just add a space between the `regexp` and the `{$param}` ?

is there a possibility that this is not extension related, but symphony
