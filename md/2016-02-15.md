Guys doing an overdue cleanup of Author Roles. Getting it to a ‘working’
state, and far more efficient… not sure who is currently using and would be
willing to be a ‘beta’ tester

Sorry, it's not me. As you may know, in my "big systems" I have authors
working from the frontend exclusively, using the backend for developers (and
administrators) only. So I never used author roles.

Yep :) I want to start going your way slowly :)  
But have a client who are a newspaper and this seems relevant for them it’s
been installed and not working for over a year so just wanted to get it right.
More frequent users would have been great for testing as they know what to
expect from the extension.

There must be someone out there using this. (Also because "my way" of doing
this has been pretty hard.)

haha yeah I get that - but for certain applications you can’t just work with
the native symphony backend.

____

I’m asking for testers mainly because the extension used to check permissions
on the table view on a ‘per-row’ basis and I’m ditching all of that code for
something more lean and which actually works...

I hope a bit more clever than the existing code…

might still be helpful :) I might not release it / send the PR right away. so
if you get to it ping me - hopefully all the necessary functionality is there
and works.

I will do. It is a remake of an existing website where I use the old authors
role

I think so. I have a copy working on 2.6.4 I think... but as I said.. without
the need for members extension

yeah this doesn’t use/need the members extension at all. It only does the
standard stuff it has right now. I am planning to do a compatible plugin in
the coming days which should handle ‘group’ permissions in the sense where you
can have a ‘field’ used to denote which group of people have permission to it.
