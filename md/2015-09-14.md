oembed field doesn't allow me to just copy/paste link into post, but into
special field.  
I'd like media integration on that level that I could add tweets, images and
what youtube into post simply by copy-pasting links - which this allows.

it’s possible to do, you’d have to create a text formatter. which would use
that library before passing through your standard markdown parser.

How much PHP do you know @diomed?

__ __

This is a skeleton of a text formatter,
<https://github.com/hananils/markdown_typography/blob/master/text-
formatters/formatter.markdown_typography.php>

__ __

If it’s placed in a /workspace/text-formatters/formatter.se9.php file you’ll
be able to modify the run() function to include that example code from their
docs

I think it would be just php. You’d have to download/include the library which
you want to use. As you have the sample code, it shouldn’t be that hard if you
start from the Markdown Formatter.

In another news.... someone put Finish translation under type 'translation'
instead of 'translations' and now cannot be found among other languages,
because it has its own type. :stuck_out_tongue:

text formatters can live in the workspace - though you could add an extension
it’s not needed. (also extension would require a bit more code)

so you’d go in blueprints / sections. Find the field where you want to use
this particular formatter. And choose that instead of “None/Markdown/Markdown
Extra” etc

hmmm

__ __

do the debug doesn’t contain any text.

__ __

rough guess might be you’ll need it to use the markdown before this formatter.

__ __

so it would give html. only issue might be that your iframes would end up with
&lt;p&gt; tags

not setting this up locally so having a rough guess.

__ __

can you add the following just before `return $html` insite formatter.s9e.php?

    
    
        $markdownFormatter = new formatterMarkdown();
        $html = $markdownFormatter->run($html)

__ __

if that says formatterMarkdown not found. this just under the other require
should do the trick

    
    
    require_once EXTENSIONS . '/markdown/text-formatters/formatter.markdown.php';

Needed all those lines, but now works like a charm.  
So, can this somehow be paired to work together with (visual) **Markdown

hmmm

__ __

good question yes but probably we will need to hack / edit the markdown
editor.

__ __

The thing is this - symphony sees your custom formatter as an editor. The
markdown editors I’ve used usually specifically check for all the fields where
the editor is “Markdown” or one of it’s variants. As yours doesn’t go by that
name it might not add the UI however everything should work exactly the same
