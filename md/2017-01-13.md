Hey guys, I'm having an issue with the Members: Activate Account event in the
Members Extension. Wondering if anyone has any insights.

When I create a member they have a valid code in the Activation field. However
as soon as I submit the activation page form on my site it expires the
activation code and the user is not activated.

____

I 'm submitting `fields[username]` `fields[activation]` & `members-section-id`

____

Also `action[members-activate-account]`

____

The event response is as follows:

____

`<members-activate-account result="error"> <message message-id="104">Member
event encountered errors when processing.</message> <activation
label="Activation" type="invalid" message-id="304" message="Activation error.
Code was invalid or has expired."></activation> <post-values>
<email>*****@gmail.com</email>
<activation>4ecbb467c72be394f00cedb055339e0827e900db</activation> </post-
values> </members-activate-account>`

invalid codes. You could hack the function to write the time values to a log
file to see what is going wrong.

hours. But this might not always be the case?

____

In your `sym_fields_memberactivation` DB table, what is the value of
`code_expiry` for this field? It should be "24 hours", so I wonder how it can
output "24".

Hi guys, sorry for silly questions, still learning my way around the
awesomeness that is symphony. I want to call Apache Fop
(<https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/>) after creating the .fo from the xml.
Can anyone give me pointers to how to start? Ideally the user would simply
press a button or whatever and an event is fired but I don't know symphony's
core to know where to start.

I have also created a much simpler extension, which doesn't save the PDF file
(but does the processing every time on page load). It is very simple, but it
works well (apart from speed, which is always an issue with FOP). If you are
interested in that, I can ask the client if I can send you some code.

Create PDFs from XSL-FO. I heard that XSLT was only invented to help creating
XSL-FO files. (At least it is sure that XSL-FO is older than XSLT.) Since
Symphony deals so much with XML, it feels pretty "natural" to describe print
documents with XML (which is the rationale behind XSL-FO).

____

You need Java on the server in order to run Apache FOP (which, unfortunately,
is the only Open Source FO processor).

I've been generating print PDF's of books, the users just have to enter the
content. I've been doing the PDF generation manually so far but want to
automate it. The user has no need to wait for a designer to typeset it in
InDesign etc but receives the typeset PDF "almost" instantly. (The stylesheets
for different book imprints etc have been pre-programed).  
It creates epub and mobi (Kindle) files as well as xhtml output of the book.  
It needs work but is getting there.

HTML > PDF normally uses CSS, which is not really good for print requirements.
Apart from that, XSL-FO is a W3C (XML) standard. It's used a lot in
professional printing.

mine does it "on-the-fly" when requesting a Symphony page with a special page
