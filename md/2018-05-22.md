@stuartgpalmer indeed. And we should keep the current behavior as the default

@nitriques should we fork the integration or master branch to add the
delimiter filter?

when you fork, you fork the whole repo

but yeah, create a new branch from the `integration`branch and submit your PR
against the `integration` branch

Is anyone using [Author
Roles](http://symphonyextensions.com/extensions/author_roles/) or a similar
extension to apply role based access to Symphony?

@stuartgpalmer I'm using [Group
Lock](http://symphonyextensions.com/extensions/group_lock/) which "seeks to do
what Author Roles extension does not cover in terms of permissions"
