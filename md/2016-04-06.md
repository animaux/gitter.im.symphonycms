@nitriques no worries; quick question maybe you know. When we haev 404s; any
way we can pass which datasource is causing the 404? And what the ds error is
to the actual error page?

Yes we could add this to the root node

would be awesome :) any indicators? would happily do this - debugging a 404
(for previews) and itâ€™s a pain to find the DS triggering it with over 20
attached...

but it can be hard to check since there may not be attached to the real 404
page

____

Please log it on github ;)

I'd prefer to add such information to the log file. (Which should also be
simpler than adding it to the 404 page.)

Yes, but @jonmifsud needs to know which Data Source caused that. Couldn't that
be implemented easily (letting the Data Source push a message to the log
before triggering the 404)?

Ah yeah for sure

For debug that 's nice

I was thinking that he needed the value in the xslt

Ah not in xslt somewhere to see it via debug or log. Debug would make easier
than shifting through logs

Maybe, but we would be kind of "polluting" the param pool...

Not the param pool, the root ds node

Ah! That sounds nice, but as you said before: The DS would not be attached to
the 404 page, would it?
