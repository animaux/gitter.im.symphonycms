made it!

so symphony generates the js?

__ __

I love symphony when I use it to generate something else than html, I feel it
s a great cms for that

There's LOTS of query for the interface, symphony and xslt generates als the
inline css and html in the final banner

__ __

And some js...

__ __

I doubt it's even possible without XSLT
