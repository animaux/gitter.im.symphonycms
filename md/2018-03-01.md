If I want all traffic to a symphony site to be https, do I set that in the
config file or the root .htaccess file? - thanks.

You could also use a Cloudflare (thereâ€™s a free version) to force https and it
sorts your cert for you as well.

JIT question... JIT seems to be rotating some user-uploaded photos. Here are
examples of a photo uploaded by the user and the same photo cropped by JIT:

<https://www.slsc.org.uk/workspace/uploads/member-photos/img_0443.jpg>  
<https://www.slsc.org.uk/image/2/600/800/5/uploads/member-photos/img_0443.jpg>

I assume that JIT is ignoring some kind of orientation meta data which is
embedded in the JPG file. Does anyone know if there is a way around this?

Thanks @wdebusschere it looks like that fix never saw the light of day. But I
understand the issue better now :-)
