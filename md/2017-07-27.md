@pixelninja I feel most qustions do go answered but there not many questions
asked … they are asked here and tend to get lost in the timeline. I tried to
save this timeline and make it searchable in github, but that has to be
updated manually from time to time:

Apart from that there sure is a massive decline in usage. Still there are
quite a few people hooked to symphony because there is not really something
that can do things the way symphony does.

I recommend a sticky post at the top of the forum saying discussion has gone
to Gitter and tips on how to search its static archives in Google, e.g. a
[very specific
search](https://www.google.com/search?&q=site%3Agitter.im%2Fsymphonycms%20members%20migration)
using [operators](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433)
`site:gitter.im/symphonycms members migration`then possibly even go as far as
preventing new posts..?

You are very welcome to! I might be able to make it sticky then `:)`

____

There are way too many loose ends in terms of docs.

____

I think  @nitriques and his team are on a good course to straighten things
out.

@nitriques My apologies, but I'm not very familiar with the front-end side of
Symphony, as most of this project has been trawling through the site's 150
extensions and making sure the PHP code all works with the latest Symphony
core. Are you indicating that I need to add a new set of Multilingual Fields
and use those instead?

I would not lock the forum until we have a proper replacement cc @animaux
@cylkee But I am looking forward to it.

____

@TwoWholeWorms yes that's what I am suggesting

@nitriques I feel very strongly that a forum-replacement should not be in
third-party hands, like gitter, medium, etc.

It might be hard to argue since so much relies on github these days, for
example.

____

Quite a few services have shut down already.

____

Most of the times there is time to save and migrate.

____

But why should something as straightforward as a forum be in third-party
hands?

I don’t see any benefit over using medium instead of the symphony blog. It all
just scatters everywhere.

____

Hmn.

shame about the usage drop. There's nothing like Symphony out there... Is
there something we could do to push it globally? Get some awareness etc? My
agency is based in New Zealand and I don't know of any other agency that uses
it here, and my clients sure have never heard of it but once they use it
they're amazed at it's intuitiveness.

____

I use it exclusively in my agency so it 's in my best interest to see Symphony
succeed :D that being said, if there's anything I can do to help with the
codebase or future developments I'd be more than happy to help.
