Hello all. It's been a while for me but I'm back on a Symphony-powered site.
Does anyone happen to know if ETM works with Sym 2.6?

@animaux, Okay, I'll give it a go. :) Thanks. I'm just working through the
site's extension list, trying to get rid of anything unnecessary and working
out what is and isn't likely to work after upgrading. Always good fun.

I'm upgrading from 2.3.6. Do I need to go 2.4 &gt; 2.5 &gt; 2.6, or should I
go straight for 2.6? (The latter I guess.)

Okeydoke. I need to convert some SSM fields to SBL ones and see what happens
with a few other extensions which don't officially have 2.6 support yet. This
is all in a local dev copy for now, of course.

takes over from SSM? It looks like the 'editor' and 'output' extensions are

this was either caused by a delete or some other confusion in Symphony… would
be interesting to know how you got to it exactly.

__ __

@DavidOliver yes optional but you might want to use them. Editor allows you to
click and the page opens in a ‘modal’ similar to what SSM used to do with the
Drawer.

__ __

the output extension does the same trick as SSM including the selected field
output as part of the original datasource. It’s optional as you might opt to
use chaining instead.

SBL / Association have 90% the same code if not mistaken but we’ll be actively
mantaining the Association Field going forward with new features, which is
already much better than SBL with the sister extensions

I am not sure about that. In my understanding, there has not been any
commitment on one of the fields. They simply co-exist.

@DavidOliver: I decided to keep the SBL field because I always try to stick
with the most future-proof extensions. And I had the feeling that it would
never go away. And just in case the core team would deprecate the SBL field,
there must be a flawless replacement process, because the SBL field was
**the** field to handle the stuff for a long time.

it’s certainly non-experimental and should be future proof. I’ve got a bunch
of websites using it now so I’m bound to mantain the whole set of fields.

__ __

In any case where for some reason we opt for another ‘link field’ I’ll need an
automatic migrator as I have too much stuff based on it at this point to
handle manually.

I also have experimental extensions / new functionality which goes hand-in-
hand with Association Fields + related UI

Oh by the way @jonmifsud we have a very good children’s tv-show in germany
called »Die Sendung mit der Maus« which is all about explaining how stuff
works. They usually open telling what's on the show today in german and then
in a foreign language which they will only reveal after they are through.

I have performed the update. The site home page is now merely a load of
garbled characters, like an encoding issue. Time to update the extensions me
thinks! I'll carry on tonight/tomorrow as I have to go and watch more episodes
of the Maus now. ;) Thanks, all. Bye for now.

I have a question about compatibility in the meta XML file. The extension site
behaves differently. Symphony accepts an extension with `min= 2.3.x` and
without `max` attribute as compatible with Symphony 2.6. The extension site
does not list it as compatible. So what is the right way?

I tried to read the whole discussion. Still, I am not sure what to do. :-(
Should I add a `max` attribute to my extensions?

Not sure either … depends on what you want to see in the compatibility matrix
I guess.

So if I have `min="2.3.x"`, and I want the extension to be marked as
compatible with 2.6.x, I must have a `max` attribute (either `2.6.x` or
`2.x.x`)?

Ah, the cron job must have rolled over my extension!

The working one on my dev-site is:
`http://symphonyextensions.com/extensions/are_you_sure/?action=delete`

The one one the browse extensions list is
`http://symphonyextensions.com/extensions/are_you_sure/?action=delete`

Hey

I’m that guy that Symphony working nicely on Docker
(<http://www.getsymphony.com/discuss/thread/111705/>)

I’ve got a Dockerfile working from the main repo rather than a separate one
now (<https://github.com/DavidForster/symphony-2/blob/docker/Dockerfile>).

Shall I create a pull request? It would be cool to set up an official Symphony
account at Docker hub and get this building automatically!

@jonmifsud @michael-e @animaux @andrewminton Pro tip: you can call the cron

name&gt;/ i.e. <http://symphonyextensions.com/system/update/field_metakeys/> .
Please be nice haha

> Shall I create a pull request?

I do not want to be rude, but I would say no. I would say no since adding
docker means we would have to support other things then the code ourself. And
another dev would also want a vargrant file and so on...

Yeah, thought about that. Could just add tags to the build so you end up using
