@michael-e is it possible in `ENM` to get a newsletter-preview for only a
single entry?

Hi Everyone,  
I'm really new to the symphony extension development and currently developing
a extension. And i need to know how to debug and see the results when we
developing the extension's function. as example i need to check the what are
the values coming to the "$context['post_values']" .

My code:

public function processEventData( $context ) {  
$values = $context['post_values'];  
$value = $values->recaptcha;  
if($value == 1){  
$status = true;  
}else{  
$status = false;  
}  
$context['messages'][] = array('recaptcha', $status, (!$status ? 'invalid.' :
NULL));  
}

I wonder if there is some solution that runs »inside« the mySQL engine itself.

____

I think I had this running successfully in `2.6.x` on a test-site:

more caching the entry idd. Use case is that the client likes to have a
development environment for multiple languages but als update content in the
live environment

@animaux what do you mean with "ENM newsletter-preview for a single entry"? A
browser preview for a dedicated recipient? Nope.

For a dedicated entry in the newsletter-section.

____

@moretaste I see, and you want to able to sync the content later on.

In my big system, authors have a preview — but not in the backend. (As you
know, I don't like to pimp the backend.) My preview is a frontend page that
includes the email templates. It has a page parameter which must be added to
the entry datasource. Now all you need is a link to the preview page. You may
use the HTML panel extension, for example.

Not that I am aware of. But it looks like it might be implemented rather easy.
I read that you are in hacking mode anyway. :-)

I _rehacked_ it . I was able to select all groups, but after saving only the
one’s selected in the field settings remained checked …

____

So I settled with five groups that the user can edit.

____

Ok, a frontend page set to admin-page-type sounds good. I should be able to
simply link to the e-mail-template then?

____

Ok, working.

____

Thanks.

@michael-e I’ve simply added a button via backend-assets.

____

@moretaste I have struggled with problems like that too. Have yet to find a
really good solution.

____

You could always export/import csv/xml.

export/import is an option. But that way I will lost the original created and
edit dates.

@moretaste CDI works fine if you set it up correctly

____

I’ve used it on a few projects but I’ve been on and off depending on the
usecase and people working on it

____

I might train my team to use it as we start switching more people

____

there are some tricks/things it doesn’t work well with such as URL Router; and
if you’re a multiple-dev team you would need to be clever with making sure you
use mysql offsets so entry-ids don’t clash

QUESTION: I noticed on all of the Symphonists plugins... there was a commit
message... "Update for Symphony 4.x". Symphony 4.x??? Is there a new version
of Symphony that is being released... is that 2.7.x branch?
