Good morning everyone, is there anyone around who has experience with using
Members with multiple active members sections? I'm looking for a way to have a
unified login for two sections and I'm not sure if it's possible (the docs
seem to be a bit out of date).

I’ve looked into it but never implemented that yet. I believe each form
requires the section id; so to get one form wokring with both it might need
some modifications to go through the `sections`

AFAIK, the restriction is: A Member can only be logged in to a single Members
section.

@michael-e: that sounds logical but that's also not what we'd like to do. We
have two separate user groups and their data is – for historical reasons –
stored in different sections with completely different data sets. But they are
accessing the same members area. Which is why we'd like to have a single login
page but would like Members to validate the login against both our members
sections.

Hmn, maybe you could add an intermediate page in the login process that grabs
the login data from the first page, checks which section the member belongs to
and then send the login data to the form with the right section-id.

____

Wouldn’t have to be _to_ roundabout, but might be a security issue.

@animaux’s suggestion seems pretty simple. Only possible issue/concern if you
have the same email addresses in both sections. (if you’d only use email to
validate instead of sending the password/login details twice)

Hi, anyone have any tips for quickly discovering which Sections have a
Reflection Field? As opposed to laboriously clicking each Section in the UI.

____

I 'm thinking it probably involves phpMyAdmin, but any tips gratefully
received.

@cylkee yes, have a look in the DB.

____

In `sym_fields` look for all fields with `type = reflection` .

In `parent_section` you will have the id of the sections.

____

You can look up the section’s names in `sym_sections` then if you need.
