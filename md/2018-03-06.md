Need some advice: we have a admin page dashboard where we display the number
of entries for each section.. What's the best approach to display this count?
Create 15 datasources and display the [pagination/@total-
entries](mailto:pagination/@total-entries) or create 1 custom datasource with
15 symql queries?

if you want efficiency the latter - if you want quick the former.

@jonmifsud Thanks, maybe the last one is faster to create :)
