Further to my comment above, the problem with the encoded apostrophes
persists. So if I have the value of "Stuart's" in the database (using dynamic
text field), the data is output as:

    
    
    Stuart&apos;s

If I use this code, the value displays correctly as "Stuart's:

    
    
    <xsl:value-of select="role" disable-output-escaping="yes" />

However, even using @cylkee's solution, I am stuck with the & apos; encoding
when the input field renders. Does anyone have any ideas? I see that in my
note above, Markdown converted the & apos; character so my request may not
have been clear.

@stuartgpalmer I thought that the problems where the double quotes, sorry. You
should output the "unformatted" version of your text in order to achieve what
you want: you should not try to ouput formatted values into an attribute IMHO

Hi @nitriques. I am using the dynamic text field to store the data and there
is no option to choose formatted or unformatted. I guess it may be a
limitation of the field that the formatting is not correctly encoded. With
that in mind I am hoping there may be an XSL solution.

Incidentally the problem doesn't happen on the dev server which runs on
(Ubuntu 12, Symphony 2.6.x, PHP 5.3.10, MySQL 5.4) but does happen on the
production server (Ubuntu 16, Symphony 2.6.x, PHP 5.6, MySQL 5.7)

@stuartgpalmer I can check on the possibility of `unformatted` I had originall
added the formatted option as I required it to enable some simple markdown at
times.

@stuartgpalmer sadly, I would try to stay away from PHP 5.3 and MySQL 5.4, as
both are EOL

and BTW, what 's the problem with having encoded entities in the attribute
values ?
