@nitriques Do you have any idea regarding the issue found by @tiloschroeder?
It's really strange, because the session remains intact after the event has
been triggered and the page gets loaded. But on the following page request,
the Member is logged out (and the session is deleted).

Maybe  @brendo?

Well, the login process does not occur in an event: doing so it not supported

I don't understand why the Member is logged out if a native Symphony event
saves the password (even if you save the same/existing password). I mean, I
don't understand which mechanism destroys the session data and logs the Member
out. And what's really strange: It doesn't happen when the page (which has
been set in the form action) gets built and loaded, but on the next click
afterwards.

On the spot, I do not know, I would have to read the code and setup a test rig

____

Is there a github issue opened on that matter ?

____

(and are you feeling better Michael? I sure do hope so)

Yes, it's geting better each day now. Already 60 percent! :-)

____

No, AFAIK there is no GitHub issue.  @tiloschroeder might create one, I think.
