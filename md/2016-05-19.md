I just stripped the middle out and it worked fine :)

@munki-boy I had that too a few years ago. Can’t remember how I fixed it. Can
you be a bit more specific?

I have a ds filter like: `'455' => '{$url-category}, {$ds-src-prod-cat-
main.url}',` but the ds param doesn't filter and instead returns all the
entries. When I put in the literal value of that param than the filter works
as expected

Is the `$ds-src-prod-cat-main.url` itemized maybe?

E. g. `<ds-src-prod-cat-main.url><item>…</item><item>…</item>…</ds-src-prod-
cat-main.url>`

Ah wait it is an ajax page and there goes it wrong

The ajax page got all values as param so behaviour is as expected

@animaux It's working fine thanks, I just stripped the CDATA tags out and used
the data for my URL, no problems. Thanks for asking :thumbsup:
