@reygoch it works with a get parameter

____

filter your datasource by tags using {$url-yourtag} and attach the datasource
to your page

____

then in the url of your page add ?yourtag=foo,bar

____

your datasource will be filtered wit coma separated values

____

you can still add ?yourtag=foo,bar &debug to check the xml

____

no need to add the url parameter in the page settings parameters

check out <http://www.getsymphony.com/learn/concepts/view/url-parameters/> to
see difference between page params and get params

@vdcrea this is how I'm currently doing it, and it is the whole problem.

____

Try creating a form with multiselect field and submit it (not section form,
just normal html form). Forms that have multivalue fields don 't generate
those values as `?field=val01,val02...` but they generate them as
`field=val01&field=val02`. Right now you need to override that behavior with
javascript to make it work properly.

____

Also, you can 't easily mark wich elements were selected on the postback.
You'd have to compare each select option with `url-param` string. It would be
nice to have all those values as nodes.

when you create filter to submit data to section, I'm not refering to that.

____

I thought I 'd just point it out

I d try:
fields[tags][0]=Blue&fields[tags][1]=Brown&fields[tags][2]=Interesting, but
this is just a guess ^^ I never needed such use case...

but this seems like essential feature for any kind of directory that requires
some filtering

____

sure, you 'd do it with custom filter, but it should be possible just by using
sym interface

____

I mean, how would you filter articles by multiple tags without javascript?

with url parameter

____

/articles return all articles, and /articles/filtered/?tag=foo+bar return
articles tagged foo and bar

____

I 'd do something like this i think

____

for the field in front, I obviously would need js to change spaces in + and
redirect to the right url

____

if the tag has multiple words, it s tricky ^^
