Hey all, has anyone noticed that JIT 2.0 isn't functioning the same way that
older versions did? I upgraded from JIT 1.17 and noticed that I cannot use "2
resize and crop " because the functionality only appears to crop using the
same aspect ratio of the image and not what I specified:

My DEV site:

Same exact parameters.

Ah OK thanks, Wannes.

____

Now I just need to figure out how to back it out and go back to old version -
haha

____

I 'll try just downloading old version and overwriting that extension
directory

I haven't experimented with 3.0 just yet - still trying to get everything to
work on 2.7.7

@ashrimplin `JIT 2.x` is ridden with problems. You should use the latest `1.x`
version. We should state that in bold letters somehwhere @nitriques `;)`. At
the moment it really looks like `2.x` would be the way to go, when it really
is a gate to hell.

Help! Website with 16.000 entries and datasource depending on other datasource
(with $this->_dependencies array) sometimes doesn't show the entries on the
frontend

____

This worked perfect with less entries... refreshing the page manually helps to
see the records (I use paging 300limit)

____

Deleting the datasource filters that come from the other datasourceoutput
works, but then i don 't have the filters i need
