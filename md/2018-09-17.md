you would need to get a little bit creative I think; starting by joining the
two XML files before sending it to an XSLT processor.

Interesting question, but as there are plenty really good tools to compare
files: do you really NEED to do this via XSLT?

I second @animaux’s reply unless you’re really tied XSLT doesn’t necessarily
seem like the right/most efficient tool for the job

Does look limited though.

actually we dont want to use any tools that are available in the market as
they are not free and they charge

____

so would like to develop the code where i need to compare the xml files and
list the differences

____

either in c# .net or xslt

____

iam new to this field and your advises are most valuable for me

The exslt-extension is available through libxml on most Apache servers and not
commercial.

____

Is this some automated comparison, or will it be invoked by hand anyway?

@vramsprsk Honestly, it is really simple to compare two or more XML files
using XSLT – you can always load more than one XML file using XPath's
`document()` function. And you can easily perform XSLT transformations from
the command line using `xsltproc`. But you'd need to learn how XSLT works
(including the `<xsl:key>` function which can often make processing much
faster for big data sets). If you don't have the time to properly learn XSLT,
look for a different solution.
