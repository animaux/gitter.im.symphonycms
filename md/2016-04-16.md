yeah so it’s not just plain old websites it’s a very powerful CMS :)

__ __

before the frontend I had a couple of `apps` using plain backend with a few
reports. but this works with the members extension for logins etc

it’s not an actual representation of the current status. needed to fill some
data for the charts. Anyway I’m not just doing `freelance` anymore have a
couple of team members. so numbers would need to be better than they used to
be I guess

thought so but wanted to clarify in case someone read your comments and
thought that those are actuals - just wanted to give an idea once the app is
live we’ll post it on show-case. for now it’s in restricted beta phase with a
few sample clients

@nitriques symphonists/encrypted_input#1

__ __

Doesn’t look all too complicated, but still beyond my PHP skills to do
anything about the mcrypt deprecation …

__ __

Though it apparently should work through `PHP 7.1` if I understand correctly.

> mcrypt deprecation

Most likely it’s been deprecated because it’s not considered secure any more
but I didn’t read through the stuff

I just flew over it quickly.

Guess it still adds _some_ more security though.

Trying to install `encrypted input` I get: `Fatal error: Call to undefined
method Administration::saveConfig() in
/…/extensions/encrypted_input/extension.driver.php on line 20`

__ __

I guess `Administration::saveConfig()` got replaced somewhere on the way to
`2.7.x`?

            Symphony::Configuration()->set('english', $this->languages['english'], 'datetime');
            Symphony::Configuration()->write();

__ __

I guess you’d use the configuration write as above :)

__ __

probably there are some things above which mgiht need amending as somewhere he
needs to set the config settings
