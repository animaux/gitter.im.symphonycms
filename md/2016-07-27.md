so.. I'm having a weird issue with `$page-types` variable, when I try to use
it, it says it hasn't been declared, but debugger is showing that it is
declared

I think I remember this issue from before, but can't recall what was the
problem / reason.

Did you check the manifest/config.php file?

@reygoch does `/data/params/page-types` has a value ? I do not thing it ever
was available as a variable

It does, I used that instead of variable, but variable still doesn't work even
though it is declared / visible in debugger

did you forget a $ or a pair of {} ?

____

if you want to use the value of the parameter/variable inside an attribute,
you should wrap it in a pair of {}: attr= "<http://{$variable}>"

@reygoch that's a problem: you do not see variables in the debugger, only the
xml nodes. Variables are injected in the xslt engine. They "should" map to the
params node, but that's not guaranteed. Use the node to create your own
variable, since "magic" variables will be removed in 3.0.0 ;)
