Hi guys, I'm working on an all Spanish website. I'm just learning so working
my way through Symphony. How do you display Form validation in Spanish instead
of English? Many thanks.

Hi Peter, I believe you would need the Spanish language translation (assuming
it exists); and if set up correctly it would serve error messages in spanish.

Thanks. I don't see a Spanish translation extension. Would I need to start
with Localisation Manager

I believe that is only required to edit translations

but it might be a good idea especially if the translation extension is
somewhat old

One thing you might need is to set the language of the frontend to Spanish
(unless that would be your default one) - but I’ve not done that in a while
@nitriques might be able to help more as presumably they would show error
messages in French

@peterfleck_twitter @jonmifsud having been working with german translations:
there are some strings that are not translated and I wasn’t even able to find
the string anywhere in the system … animaux/lang_german#7
