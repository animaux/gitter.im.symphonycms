@nitriques an update on the above issue… a `session_start()` before it tries
to persist the session data makes it work… Something is closing the session
before its supposed to.

But what is different on these servers? There must be s.th. different from
other installations that are working fine.

I have no idea yet. they should be LAMP stacks. I agree that I don’t believe
it’s a code issue… otherwise we’d all have the same problem

Yes, I did a fresh install of Symphony 2.7 yesterday on Debian 9 plus PHP 7.2.
No issues like this.

I think maybe its a php 7.0.30

____

I’ll ask him to update if possible to see if we have the same with a 7.2 (I’m
using 7.1/.2 on my own projects without issues)

Confirmed! It happens with PHP 7.0.30 for me as well! (I changed the PHP
version of my test installation, which is easy enough because this test server
is running with Plesk).

____

I’m trying to upgrade his server to 7.2.5 right now.

____

yep can confirm upgrading php works fine so php 7.0.30 has issues here

I had some diffuse problems in `PHP 7.0.x` too. Switching to `7.1.x` fixed it.

Symphony 2.7 has LTS, so I guess it should be fixed. BTW, I have started to
work on fixing all the `E_NOTICE`s which are suppressed by default in Sym 2.7.
If you set `error_reporting_all` to `yes` in the config, you know what I mean.

____

Unfortunately, since 2.7 also supports PHP 5, I must use the ugly ternary
operator a lot, as in `$a = isset($var) ? $var : null`

____

@josealbertorodriguesjunior Usign the REST API, it should be fesable

@nitriques do you have any idea regarding the Symphony 2.7 session issue with
PHP 7.0?
