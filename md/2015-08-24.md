@brendo working on some cache drivers (memcached) and I have a question
regarding the ‘read’ function

____

the cache.database.php (standard provided) returns an array of data stored in
the database. Whilst the APC version you had just returns the cached data.
(which to me seems correct) however there is a discrepancy on what is
returned. Shouldn’t this be the same across?

Hi folks. Does anyone if there is a way to prepopulate an `association field`
with multiple values in Symphony `2.6.x`? E. g.

`http://…/symphony/publish/termine/new/?prepopulate[135]=23+18`

____

`+`, `,` are not working, also not URL-encoded

____

with some weird results as well

____

adding multiple prepopulates for the same field fails as well

I think it’s not supported at this time:

    
    
    $this->Form->prependChild(Widget::Input(
          "prepopulate[{$field_id}]",
           rawurlencode($value),
           'hidden'
      ));

____

it doesn’t check for anything which might split the value, nor if it is an
array.. (throws a 500). It’s something from the core not the Association Field
itself

no problem, your point makes sense I guess.

____

I’m sure if  @brendo agrees we can make some changes to add support. shouldn’t
be too hard to do but not sure about any potential side effects.

Not sure if my very specific case justifies this :)

____

I can at least make sure I don’t get an error and get this kind of half-
working for now.

If you need a ‘quick fix’ it’s something that can be done but you’d have to
make sure ot mantain it over upgrades if it never makes it ot the core

true if you do manual updates especially. When I use git it tends to keep
stuff but you still have to review once in a while

____

By the way, I just checked for the issue whith sort_order and xml-output
symphonists/order_entries#71
