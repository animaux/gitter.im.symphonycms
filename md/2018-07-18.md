@stuartgpalmer I’m using it on a current site with PHP 7.2 and Symphony 2.7.7.
with filtering. And it works. Hard to tell what the problem might be.

You could try using coordinates instead of `london`.

I can imagine google geolocation might fail in the ds. Not sure if we ever
implemented the API key there.

Hi, I am trying to upgrade my Symphony from 2.5.2 to 2.7.7 and I'm trying to
'clean up/disable/remove' unused extensions. Is there a systematic way to
determine which extensions are actually used? Could I query the DB somehow? Or
is the best approach to disable what I don't believe is used and then test to
see if anything breaks?

____

I am just trying to mitigate risk of unnecessary issues with the upgrade

One more: I just upgraded from sub section manager to association. I need to
populate reflection field for over 5000 entries. My plan is to use XML
importer and update via import. I am trying to figure out the best way to get
the data. Is the best way to attach the data sources of interest to a
'temporary' page and then grab all the XML using ?debug or is there a smarter
way?

@ashrimplin there is probably no straightforward way to check which extensions
are actually »used«, since extensions hook into the system in several
different ways, e. g. providing fields, backened funtionality, datasources,
etc.

To populate the `reflection field`(for selector previews), you can use the
`resave entries` extension.

Wow - huge!

____

Makes sense re: not straightforward - all good. I am doing best guess and then
will deal with things as they come up

____

Thanks a lot,  @animaux

Sounds pragmatic! Hope it helps a bit.

Hah @animaux \- resave entries is magic, I tell you!

____

probably saved me at least 4 hours in near term - several more long term!
