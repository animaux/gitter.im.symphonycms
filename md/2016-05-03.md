Will entries created/updated by an XML-Import be reindexed in `search_index`?
Looks like not.

good question

__ __

maybe not but I’m pretty sure we could make it do that

__ __

there should be a callback which would trigger `search_index`

__ __

but you’d have to see the delegates in both.

__ __

haven’t used search index in a good while now

Looks like some legacy-imported content is making the reindex choke.

When trying to resave the above entry I get the same error. There is no CDATA
in the Database though. No idea where that is coming from …

A `&nbsp` or byte order mark maybe. I have had that several times with a
client.

__ __

But probably an &amp; that is interpreted as delimiter

@moretaste you’re right. It’s some nasty character …

⤾ Reindexing …

Apparently a NULL character. WTF?

Ok, it’s some invalid character somehow links to ligatures. Wonder where that
came from …

__ __

In german `code` is pronounced the same as `Kot` which means `dung`. This
often feels like an appropriate description, especially when handling legacy-
code.

@nitriques yeah decided to probably do-away with a big bunch of changes for
that core change. And trying to move it to an extension (which is way cooler)

__ __

but obviously the headache part is in actually remembering all the steps to
get it working. I think I’m around 50% there

haha I think I’ll need it to wrap it up.

it might mean an extra delegate or so (till I figure it out) then we see.

@nitriques calling it for now; got to rush elsewhere. Just a quick thought
&gt;
<https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/blob/master/symphony/lib/toolkit/class.field.php#L768>
is that used by extensions other than Associations? There are a lot of ‘core’
features which are directly linked to association field. I wonder if other
fields like yours potentially use that info
