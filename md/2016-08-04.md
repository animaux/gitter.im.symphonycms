Is Symphony::Engine() instanceof Frontend the best way to check if an
extension is being accessed from the frontend of a site? Having an issue with
a 2.6.2 install I can't upgrade yet.

Symphony::Engine() instaceof Frontend doesn't return a result in 2.6.2 which
is really odd. I removed the small condition in the extension code for now as
I know the appendFormattedElement is only used on the frontend anyways. It's
the incrementnumberfield for anyone who may have been interested:
