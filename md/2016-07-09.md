@michael-e for certain imports I do exactly the same thing, especially if the
data is already in another database. In times where the data is already in XML
or another symphony install I’d use the XML Importer.

I use Excel's "XML worksheet" format, but still I need a custom import script
because of my validation process. Entries that do not validate are not
imported but written to another Excel XML file after the import has finished.
So authors can download that second file, apply corrections and attempt to
import it. One can repeat that until eveything has been imported.

Ye, I used similar process when creating some custom importers for OpenCart,
though it was with CSV.

Thanks! To make it even more cool, invalid cells will have a yellow background
in the "errors file", so they are easy to spot. This thingie works so well
that the client complained about authors importing "too fast/too much"! :-)

that's why your system is a success Michael. Everything is in the detail and
ease of use.

At the end of the day it's just an "advancement". I simply try and use
everything I've learned from Symphony and everything that Symphony provides.
:-)

But the main difference is "frontend editing". That's why I always said that
the biggest shortcoming of Symphony is the backend. If you know how to build
things in the frontend, why should you torture yourself with a backend?

My Excel XML importer is running in the frontend exclusively.
