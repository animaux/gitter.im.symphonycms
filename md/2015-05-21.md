Did anyone find a workaround for when CDATA tags in the template breaks
indentation in other parts of the page output?

@moretaste Sorry for delay, I was out. If I want to put Google analytics code
into say master.xsl I have to use CDATA tags but when I do, all indentation is
lost in the rest of the page code. People used to talk about it on
getsymphony. Trouble is no whitespace means CSS :after doesn't work for some
hacky stuff like Bootstrap fully justified nav which my client wants.

____

Just view source on any of my websites like here: <http://www.munki-
boy.co.uk/>

____

Only the CDATA bit retains formatting and I don 't know another way to inject
the analytics JS widget code thing.

For the actual code I do

The issue is when you want to make this horizontal nav here:
<http://chesterfields.co.uk/ches-next/> not that I'm advocating it, client
spec.

____

See the left and right are completely justified, it works by white space in
the :after so that it seems to go over the end of the line and be like a
paragraph I guess. When the white-space is gone it doesn 't work.

basically your error must have been the ampersand sign. by encoding that it
should be rendered properly by symphony and avoids your issue all together.

Yep that one works fine that you sent, I'll try the rest myself so that I
learn. I will let you know how it goes. Thanks again. I'm pretty good at 3D
rendering and diverse other stuff. I've mentioned before but I'd be happy to
help any of you guys with anything I know about in return for all you do for
me.

in XSLT you cannot have attributes without value, the correct way to do them
is to give them the same value as the attribute as far as I’m aware

But my riddle ... I got an union datasource with two datasources from the same
source. One is a alphanumeric filter on the title and the other is an
alphanumeric filter on an alternative title. The union datasource needs to be
sort alphanumeric on both title an alt-title.

never did it like that…

only thing I’d think of is customise the DS to get both to output as  <title>
and sort via xslt not sure if there’s another way haven’t used the Union DS in
years...

I 've tried two sort, concat sort and also a sort with | (or sign) but nothing
works. The alt titles are always at the bottom

I 'm thinking of a for-each instead of apply-templates

to make it more difficult the alt-title is a tag field so it can contains

nope, it must be an alpha numeric list. So url-param is letter and the items
has to fit that as first letter

create a recursive XSLT template which outputs 1 item at a time. Pass it two
parameters being the two **sorted** datasources you have

____

in each loop determine which one of the first to items in each variable is the
first. then apply-template same template same params but this time eliminate
the entry which has been selected

it should work but not sure if you know how to get that done
