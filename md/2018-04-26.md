@michael-e ETM »Also log the recipient address when sending fails«, that’s
exactly what a customer wanted recently! `:D`

You mean ENM? Yes, I also needed this recently. Not all error responses
contain the recipient address, so now ENM logs the address together with the
response string. Still, this only works if there actually is an error response
during the sending attempt.

Oh yes, ENM!

____

There should be if it says `310 E-Mails fehlgeschlagen`, or not generally?

Yes, this count means "errors that ENM has heard of". :-) These errors are
logged.

Sometimes emails get problems **after** they have been accepted by the
receiving server. Such errors can not be logged by ENM. In these cases you
must consult the mail server log (and/or the returned emails).

____

Generally, if you send via SMTP, you will catch more errors directly (than
with Sendmail).

Hmn, not sure if bloody 1und1 gives access to the mail server logs … the
"errors that ENM has heard of" will do for now, I think. It is using SMTP. Now
the client just has to accept an hour of update and testing `;)`

____

I guess nothing should break when updating `3.4.1 —> 3.7.0`?

No, I don't think there will be serious issues. You will have to add the "HELO
hostname" for your senders.

____

But you should have a log file even with 3.4.1 which should contain most of
the failed addresses. As I said, just certain errors don 't include the
address, that's why I added it explicitely.

N’ah nothing much in the logs in `3.4.1`.

____

What exactly is the `HELO hostname` here?

____

If the mailserver is `smtp.1und1.de` *sigh* and the domain of the website
`http://wehnerwerk.de`?

You haven't seen this in Symphony's preferences before?

____

> A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your server, e.g.
"[www.example.com](http://www.example.com)".

____

So I would probably use `www.wehnerwerk.de` as HELO. (Unless you have your own
IP address and server – in this case I would use the server's _hostname_.)

____

Any FQDN which resolves to the IP address is much better than nothing. (
_Nothing_ means that Symphony will use the IP address as HELO which is against
the specs, more or less.

I _have_ , but never put anything in there `:)`

the `www.` is not neccessary, I hope?

____

Hmm, it might be.

I hate `www.`.

<https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_(Internet)#Fully_Qualified_Domain_Name_(FQDN)>

____

The www must be there, otherwise it 's not an FQDN.

____

Here you can see how it is used:
<https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol>

____

Imagine you have several servers for a domain, using different IP addresses,
of course. Like:

____

  * [www1.example.com](http://www1.example.com)

____

  * [www2.example.com](http://www2.example.com)
  * mail.example.com

These will be the hostnames of the servers, and when connecting, it is useful
to tell this name.

____

The whole idea is less useful when it comes to shared hosting. :-(

Because the receiving server can not, for example, compare the FQDN to the
result of a reverse IP lookup.

____

Well, it can, but it will fail.

But shouldn’t it rather be `smtp.1und1.de` then?

Th server name (FQDN) must not be the same as—let's call it the "publicly
visible address". In many cases it will be, but in the example above both
servers (www1… and www2…) will be reachable with the "www" domain name on port
80/443. Nevertheless they are different servers, having different hostnames.

____

Imagine a connection from  "www1" to a mail server. It will use
"[www1.example.com](http://www1.example.com)" as HELO.

____

Anyway the HELO/EHLO is _your_ FQDN, not the one of the receiving server.
