Hi All,

Can someone please tell me is there any way of getting all the navigation
items in the backend and associate links of them ? Also is there anyway of
inserting some html to the frontend via an custom extension?

Thanks.

@pixelninja how do you choose the variation on the frontend? Could you give a
an example of the content? I guess not everything is multiple?

I have a custom utility I use in conjunction with IP localisation to display
the correct node. Content could be a different image, to show different
terrain in each country. Or variations in English (USA specifically). Not
every field no, just some select ones. Like the main copy textbox or image
upload.

I’m thinking of writing an extension for the Section Manager, for duplicating
an already created field. It’d replicate everything except the handle field.

@pixelninja have you considered the multilingual fields? You can just use them
for localisation.

____

I’ve never done for you scenario but you should be able to use en-us / en-gb
etc

____

and you would only make the primary one required

Ahh ok I didn’t realise it worked with different English variations.

____

I’ll check it out!

might save you a lot of problems! re images you still need to be a bit
creative though

@peterfleck_twitter by looking at the twitter code, it should be SUPER easy to
do, since they both support oAuth

____

but I won 't do them until I need it
