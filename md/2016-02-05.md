Seems like it hasn't worked, 2.7.x is at the same commit as 2.6.x:

Could someone do a tiny edit on XML Importer extension? If an importer has a
name with two or more words "my-import" then after the import has run on the
screen where the URL is

____

    
    
    symphony /extension/xmlimporter/importers/run/locations/

____

The link back to the importer is broken because the XML Importer expects
"myimport", where there is no hyphen inserted. So the link is broken for
importers with a multi-word name.

Oh maybe it's not a tiny edit, maybe have to change XML Importer to use the
hyphen.
