@nitriques / @brendo \- small thing which I noticed by coincidence whislt
going through some 500 server errors for a client. should `<url-}></url-}>`
ever be generated in the XML? url which generated the said issue:
`/video/301991/%7B-/??????-%7D/&debug` note the encoded braces. PS the link
shouldn’t be valid anyway but still curious.

Ah, Symphony’s .htaccess rules converted to nginx? I am curious as well! Is
there a Gist somewhere?

No but I guess I could create one. the one I have is more like a mix between
the apache virtual host config and htaccess. Not sure if it could be a stand
alone thing

I wouldn't mind the mixture, just curious about the rewrites. I have some
experience with nginx (as frontend server), so I would find my way. If you
like, you can also send it via email. (My email address can be found on
[www.michael-e.de](http://www.michael-e.de))
