@michael-e , Is there any way of attaching a custom event filter to the
storage event ?

This is so f ****** brilliant:
<https://www.getsymphony.com/discuss/thread/87656/1/> Why have I never used
this before?

Thanks @michael-e !  
Can you please tell me whether I can access output parameters ($context)
within my own event in `load()` function ?

@animaux Yes it is, we should create a library somewhere with xsl function
snippets

@nimanthaharshana No, I don't think that this is possible. Generally, in
Symphony, events are executed before data sources. So you can never access DS
output params in events.

@animaux Yes, the last one is from 2016, but would also be handy to be able to
fork them and to do improve pull requests :)

Easy to do with github gists, it might only need a common tag.

Hmnn, looks like there is no way to tag gists with `symphony-cms`.

<https://www.gistoapp.com/documentation/> @animaux apparently you do it in the
title. Haven't tried it.

This is my first selfmade xsl-function, a helper for using translated strings
in symphony xsl-templates:

I think I will do some more in the coming time. It makes the code a lot more
compact than having to resort to templates all the time.
