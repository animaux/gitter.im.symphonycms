Hello - I want to include a link to a Vimeo video on my site. Does anyone know
how to add that functionality? I can just include a link to YouTube already in
the UI. Hope that makes sense...and thanks.

I think I answered my own question :)

Happy new year, fellow Symphonists! Does anyone around know if it is possible
to provide a Members login where the user can use the same input field to
either provide an e-mail address or an username? As the wiki states, it's
possible to login with either the e-mail address or the username but this
still needs explicit fields for either the one or the other value
(`fields[username]` vs. `fields[e-mail]`). Is there a way to have a unified
input field for both values (`fields[username-or-e-mail]`)? Thanks!

Happy new year Nils, I’ve never tried it - but based on a rough idea of the
php codebase I don’t think we have a kind-of fallback baked in.

Thanks Jonathan, that's how I read the code as well. The wiki just makes it
sound possible.

Maybe this is a question for @brendo or @michael-e: Would it hurt security to
allow such an unified Members login? It makes a lot of sense from the UX
perspective to have an unified field, if it doesn't matter if I use the
username/password or the e-mail/password combination to log in.

yeah I’ve never used a `username` because it adds an extra layer of complexity
to have to deal with one or the other. at least I’d rather not have to
remember the username I used.

Well, you still have to remember which of your 100 e-mail addresses you used

We are migrating a site that used plain http authentification with a
username/password combination and while the new site login will be e-mail-
based we thought it would be nice to allow basic login with the old
credentials (we have "retired" users that might come back from time to time
that don't need a personal login)

very valid thought

I’d have wanted to do the same if you have the old passwords

____

also in case you have a request integration for Facebook Logins with Members,
ping me I should have something working, just not polished enough for a public
release.

By the way, is there a reason why the Members extension doesn't use a standard
Symphony event to handle the login? This extension is so helpful (thanks
Brendan and Michael!) but is messes around with some core behaviours that
makes it quite hard to understand and follow (why do things happen and when do
they happen). It's like being a child again and your parents tidied up your
room: you are completely lost because everything is in the wrong place. And I
know, same as my parents, the developers only had the best reasons to do the
things the way they did ;)

Standard events try to save, you can’t really create your own event for the
sake a of a login… default functionality would have to be overwritten using a
pre-save filter, and if something else goes wrong you might end up updating a
users entry. I presume that is the thought behind it

By default they do; unless you create a new `event type` not a Section event
maybe. - but maybe using `member-action` vs `action` is what you are referring
to.. in that case you’re completely right the naming convention does mess with
you…
