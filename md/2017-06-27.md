@nitriques \- We need to (a) send an email reminder and (b) update the
corresponding entry with the date that the email reminder was sent. The only
way I know how to initiate this process is to post a form to the event and to
send an email with an ETM filter.

My question is... How (via cron) can we send a form to the event which is pre-
populated with the output of a datasource? My guess is that we might need to
customise the event?

@nitriques could you remove
<http://symphonyextensions.com/extensions/uniqueindex/> from the extensions
site? The owner has transfered it to me and I’d like to add it under new
ownership.

No extension needed, if you don’t need spefically formatted notification
e-mails.

@stuartgpalmer on then if you already have it working, then simply use curl to
do the post in a cron job ! curl --data="field1=test&field2..."

Merci @nitriques ... that sounds like the missing part of the puzzle. I will
give it a whirl.
