Hi All,  
I'm trying to do some curl request on custom event file. i have assigned the
event to page and giving a curl request to the page while event executing.

this is my code and i need to update member section 'paid-until' field.
currently $res returning 'No'

____

    
    
        //Execute the update-member-payment event 
                         $post_data = array(
                            id => 11,
                            fields[paid-until] => '12/12/2012',
                            action[update-member-payment] => 1
                        );
    
                            $proc_query = http_build_query($post_data);
    
                            $url = 'https://my-web/pay-subscription';
                $ch = curl_init();
                            curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url);
                            curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FAILONERROR, 1); 
                            curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER,1);
                            curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, 3);
                            curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS, CURLPROTO_HTTPS);
    
                           // curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, 1);
                            curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS,$proc_query);
                            // receive server response ...
                            curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
                            curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false);
                            $server_output = curl_exec ($ch);
                            curl_close ($ch);
                            //further processing ....
                            if ($server_output == "OK") { $res ='Done'; } else { $res ='No'; }
                        //End of Execute the update-member-payment event

@SagaraZD I think you will need to debug (var_dump) your $server_output

____

  * do you execute this code inside execute(), did you add the execute() do your trigger function?

Actually this code on other event file. I'm executing one standard event from
inside another custom event and that is why sending the curl.

Just copy all your php curl code in a new empty php file

____

and debug/fix it

____

then add it to the event

____

Also I don 't see any authentification (username, pass / token) in your code
