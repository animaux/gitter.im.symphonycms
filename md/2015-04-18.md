Guys any particular reason why symphony outputs an expire header with date:
Mon, 12 Dec 1982 06:00:00 GMT ?

To be safe, it is far in the past. But I don't know why it's this special
date. Maybe someone's birthday?

Thanks @michael-e, just wanted to confirm itâ€™s for caching purposes. Had a
server admin asking why the date appeared like that, as they want to do some
server caching.

Could be a birthday not sure who though, we might have to look for the commit.

This is very old, so I doubt you can still find out anything. Maybe @allen
knows.
