@wdebusschere \- We tracked down the issue. Both myself and clients were
copying and pasting the URL of uploaded files and images from the file upload
field. We hadn't noticed that these URLs have spaces after each slash.
Presumably so that longer URLs wrap nicely onto new lines. The spaces don't
show up obviously in the DB or the debug output. Thanks for taking the time to
help though!

Sounds like the JavaScript `oncopy` event could help the UI there, and/or a
'copy to clipboard' button.
