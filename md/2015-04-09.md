@nitriques Safer and more efficient to do the delete than to look for what
changed and issue a partial update

____

@jonmifsud I’ve had that before as well with earlier Symphony. Never could
find out why. It’s ‘patched’ by enforcing uniqueness on the `entry_id`, but
this is ‘opt-in’ by the field and as I mentioned, is a mask

user agent string returning a 403 access denied

ah it’s general search engines you’d need to keep out, was thinking you had a
bunch of other bots which you could explicitly block. Theoretically if you
don’t want that indexed I think it’s fine. Just one thing if it’s google bot
make sure it can read your robots.txt in google webmaster tools it should tell
you that it is not allowed to check those pages.

You could potentially rewrite all the downloads through Apache so you can

@brendo is there a way to filter an association using only the ‘first’ item?
Working on a sitemap where an article can be made in multiple categories, but
would like to pick only the ones with that category as the first/primary one.

In the battle against the aggressive bots I build the pdf link with a data-

follow.

don’t expect it to have an instant effect. Bots which had already parsed the

It’s kinda how the whole extension works

____

When the page is created, a token is set in the session

____

That token is then exposed for you to use in your template

____

when the event is fired, the session token is reset

____

so really, canofspam can only be used on a single event per page

If the token passed with the form data matches what was set in the session,
then it’s deemed ‘not spam'

____

if the token doesn’t match, or doesn’t exist, it’s considered spam

It depends how you set up - if you use Ajax for submission, make sure you
obtain the canofspam token and send it with the next request. Normal Post
requests reload the page, so you should be good.

using the first item in an association for link (like a category sort of
thing) - use case would be a sitemap I don’t want to pull up items 2/3 times
in each sitemap.

12:24](https://gitter.im/symphonycms/symphony-2?at=55266f91b803850b4304c0e0)

Uh, sorta. The validation happens via an event filter. The idea is once it’s
been validated, the hash is removed from the session

____

Yep, so for the token to be regenerated after it has failed, a page reload
must take place

____

@jonmifsud I don’t think it’d be useful on a wide scale and I’m really unsure
how you’d implement it. It would require a fair bit of change in the
`buildDSRetrievalSQL`

____

The problem is in the SQL, you don’t have a concept of sortorder, it’s not
saved at all

____

The filtering function also doesn’t allow ORDER/LIMIT to be set, so you’d
almost need to run a query inside there to get the desired value, and then add
that value to the `$where`

ah, right because the order is only related to how they are stored in the
database (system id)

____

probably the only way to do it would be an join, on the table itself to ensure
there is not the same entry id, with a lower _id_

That would work because the data is deleted between saves, so you can be sure
that the ID reflects the first item

____

@moretaste Yep, you can play with URL parameters to do this

____

When I was in the agency, we’d add form-status to the /contact/ page

____

and then redirect to /contact/success/

____

If form-status was ‘success’, we’d show a success message, it also made goal
tracking with GA a little easier for us :)
