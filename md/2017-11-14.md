Hi All. Having checked a log for a 2.7.0 site (on Ubuntu 16 and PHP7) I
noticed there are loads of entries as follows:

    
    
    14/11/2017 11:29 am > Deprecated Warning: The `system:date` data-source field is deprecated. It will be removed in Symphony 3.0.0. Please use `system:creation-date` or `system:modification-date` instead. Called from `SectionDatasource::execute()` in class.datasource.section.php at line 662
    14/11/2017 11:29 am > Deprecated Warning: The method `Datasource::grab()` is deprecated. It will be removed in Symphony 3.0.0. Please use `Datasource::execute()` instead. Called from `FrontendPage::processDatasources()` in class.frontendpage.php at line 895

Because of the volume of these errors, we cannot really check the log
usefully. I can't find an issue in the repo. Should I add this?

More log stuff (on Ubuntu 16 and PHP7). A user experienced an error and this
matches his screenshot. Can anyone suggest what might have caused this?

@wdebusschere It was a standard Symphony event. Un-customised.

Sorry for not being more forthcoming with info. This error has only happened
once (to my knowledge). The event is a standard Symphony event and I just
wondered if anyone would recognise the error. If not, I think I'll wait and
see if it is reported again!

@stuartgpalmer I just checked the github issues of symphony and there is a
recent issue:

THANK YOU @wdebusschere. I found that the error appears if the user enters a
password which is too short or weak. For the moment I have fixed this by
reducing the security on passwords. Going forward (until there is a fix) I
will use JS to enforce stronger passwords.
