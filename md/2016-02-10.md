@andrewminton quick look at the code if you left the EntryVersions datasource
all you had to do was replace grab with `execute`and have it extend
`SectionDatasource`but what you did seems to make sense and is probably neater
than adding a new datasource anyway.

Yup.. I thought about that @jonmifsud it just made it neater to extend
SectionDatasource.. There were one or two file path issues I spotted as well.
May have been my environment (vagrant) so worth a test or two.

@andrewminton gotcha at the moment it works fine as-is?

____

@nitriques I was also thinking in terms of a new extension looking to have the
versioning data stored on database rather than a file. + I need some kind of
change log functionality if signed-off. If possible and there is an overlap we
might discuss / collaborate to avoid duplicating work and building multiple
extensions which do the same thing.

useful for a client in its current state... With code updates, so it worked..

Hi. I'm having rather unusual error while trying to install symphony (2.6.7).
Just after filling the form with basic info, after submit I get this:
"mt_srand() expects parameter 1 to be integer, float given" in 100th line of
\lib\toolkit\class.cryptography.php file. Anyone else experienced something
similar?

____

`t{$field_id}_{$this->_key}.value IN ('{$data}’)`

it takes any item which is in that list

there is an `$andOperation` in the buildDSRetrieval SQL but not sure exactly
how you could trigger that

hum the code contradicts the docs...

____

(preg_match( '/\s++\s+/', $value) ? Datasource::FILTER_AND :
Datasource::FILTER_OR);

____

```

    
    
    *  By default, all Symphony filters are considering to be AND filters, that is
     * they are all used and Entries must match each filter to be included. It is
     * possible to use OR filtering in a field by using an + to separate the values.
     * eg. If the filter is test1 + test2, this will match any entries where this field
     * is test1 OR test2. This function is run on each filter (ie. each field) in a
     * datasource

I do not recall or haven't tested frontend form saves tbh. It should save a
new version.. there is no provision for updating a version via front end as
that functionality is appended to the DOM using javascript and checked for
when the form data is posted. Take a look in the JS file to see what post
field is added in the action save and maybe add that as a hidden field on the
front end to test.
