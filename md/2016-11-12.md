hello @cmnstmntmn , no after few tests I achieved what i needed using 2
extensions ^^

____

I wanted to save the IP of the client along with other data, directly in the
event.  
Finally I used global param loader (to get the IP) and event default values
(to save it), not sure it s the exact name of the extensions

____

but I will probably need to dig in custom events, because I want to return a
field value (hashid) with the success event response

____

by default, success events return only id

____

is it complicated to return another field value

____

?

____

you create a new data source

____

and you filter by that id

ho ok, simple as I like ^^

____

so event response is  "reloading" the page

____

I mean, events are rendered prior to ds/page rendering ?

____

I wanted to save another http request

of using ajax to send data to an event

  1. create the event

  1. create a page of type `JSON`

I see

____

but to return a field that is not a post value: hashid field, or system date
for example are created by symphony

____

Is it possible to use line 17  <xsl:value-of select="$event/@id" /> as a
parameter

____

to filter a ds

____

for sure I can send back to client the id, then client anwser again the server
to get back those system fields values

____

but I thought it could be possible to send back with the success those kind of
field values

____

clean json btw

here's an extension that act the way you want

entry-id` will be available to filter other DS when an entry is created

(about comas in json I used to do it like you with position last, but there
was a limitation with apply-templates filtered by values, I think, don't
remember exactly, finally I do it with:

<xsl:if test=" ./following-sibling::node()">,</xsl:if>  
or <xsl:if test=" ./following-sibling::entry()">,</xsl:if>)

this way to add the coma, you can apply templates like this

<xsl:apply-templates select="events/*[name() != 'member-login-info']"> for
example, an apply-templates filtered, so the last node is not position last()
sometimes ;)

very useful trick if you work with json

for now there is one extension to manage it apipage I think, but I don 't use

well, it's json

____

but the response contain data from more than one edge

____

pretty much the way a symphonypage looks in `?debug` mode

____

you have a structure with data from multiple data sources

so, in a similar way, qraph ql will output a json with combined data, in a
single response
