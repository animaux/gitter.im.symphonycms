hi, what to do with forms and cachelite, it seems the cache make the forms not
working

____

I can exclude some urls but some forms can be included by the client on
different urls

@moretaste I’ve never used cache-lite but I would think that’s partly normal
behaviour as cachelite from my understanding would ‘check’ a request and feed
back a ‘saved’ html render. Most likely you / someone will need to edit to
make sure if the request is a `post` to not use cache but generate fresh
without saving the result

I think this line will do it: ``<input type="hidden" name="cachelite[flush-
section]" value="yes"/>` `

yep because the same thing gets served all the time.

____

@animaux whilst you can `encrypt` database data it might not always be what
you want to do. Depends on the information you are storing; and it’s
sensitivity. Keep in mind that for any encryption/decryption you have a
processing cost, and if your database/server are in the same box (assuming you
are hacked) somewhere in your code there is how to decrypt that data..

____

it’s not like password salting which is a one-way process

being exposed) but I don’t think there’s an encrypted symphony field around.

yes technically there is

____

but most of the time that approach would mean once your database is `mounted`
it’s in an unencrypted state in memory

____

so if someone gets into mysql server (and it’s on) it’s decrypted

@jonmifsud @animaux I do not have a solution right now for encryption, but
openssl or <https://pecl.php.net/package/libsodium> could help

____

But as jon said, if the web server and the mysql box is the same, the data is
still at risk if the server gets pwned

looks like mcrypt is deprecated <https://wiki.php.net/rfc/mcrypt-viking-

I need to build a form to subscribe to an event where the user can add more
people who will be join that user. So I have to submit to two sections one for
the main subscriber and a second for the others. I also need the possibility
to duplicate the second form dynamic, so the user can add unlimited others.

Does anybody have an example for this or some directions how to accomplish
this?

If you need to post to 2 sections, you need to have 2 events

____

you could copy input values into hidden fields

____

add the action as an hiddern field too

and should be good to go
