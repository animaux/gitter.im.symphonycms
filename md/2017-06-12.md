Another day, another Members question: are there known issues with special
characters in usernames? We are having weird issues with apostrophes in
usernames: symphonycms/members#286

Hmmm, I never allowed anything but letters and `-` in usernames, so I have not
experienced such issues. But a bug is a bug. :-)

But @nilshoerrmann , you know me, I would never allow apostrophes in
usernames! This is plain ugly.

It is, of course … but still it should be allowed

____

Didn 't you say something about not hiding errors but making them scream?

Yes, I agree that it's a bug! Definitely!

____

(As long as it is allowed.)

____

(I wouldn 't allow this.)

`’` or `'`? `:D`

'‘’"„”“«» — just to name some of them... :-)

All designers need them.

____

Strictly speaking an apostrophe is only this one: `’`.

____

The one that looks like a filled up `9`.

____

For some reason a `'` has the entitiy `&apos;` even though it is not a proper
one.

____

Damn those typewriters!

(The finnish word for »hairsplitter« translates into »commafucker«.)

In this case this is about the straight one `'`

____

@animaux Does the German localisation handle apostrophes in a special way? I
know you added a lot of special characters to the transliterations …

@nilshoerrmann I don’t think I added anything apostrophe-wise.

____

And if I did, I’d think I would have translated it to `NULL`

Which would be a problem if you really allow different apostrophes in
usernames.

Reminds me of the UTF8-URL-problem.
