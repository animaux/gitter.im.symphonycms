Hello, quick question... I'm using a markdown field to store comments which
can contain Emoji shortname handles i.e `:two_women_holding_hands:`

____

the issue is that Markdown converts this to `:two<em>women</em>holding_hands:`

so the emoji is something you’re doing on the Frontend with Javscript I
presume

I have some custom parsing in the Data Source which converts the Emoji back to
an <img/>

<http://symphonyextensions.com/extensions/templatedtextformatters/>

____

I suggest you try out this

____

you can / should be able to create a custom formatter - do your own parsing
and do the markdown afterwards

____

Or if not that extension; create a ‘custom’ formatter which does what you are
doing in your datasource + the standard markdown

____

it would also be faster when processing your datasources

:o never tried that link thing… it’s probably the underlying markdown library
which is used.

let me know.

I've installed the extension but I don't think the UI is fully functional with
the latest version of Symphony

hmm it’s possible I’ve not used it for a while.. but it was on my list when we
where doing some custom formatting shame…

____

____

which you can build on
