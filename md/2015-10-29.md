I've just noticed it's not possible to upload a .jpe file via "unique upload
field". I don't see the allowed file types in the extension so would they be
part of the core and can someone easily add the file extension? I think it's
just the same as .jpg and the image works if you rename to .jpg both in the
field and in the frontend.
