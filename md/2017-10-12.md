Hey folks, quick question about the **association_field** extension if anyone
can help:

I'm using version 1.0.1 (not upgraded since Dec 2016) of this extension fairly
heavily on a site but finding that it's slowing down the queries for some data
sources.

What should be `0.0185 s from 140 queries` is `2.0280 s from 950 queries`
UNLESS I physically go in and re-save that entry in the Symphony admin. Not
ideal because I have 10k+ user generated entries for the section.

Am I safe to upgrade to the latest version here?

Any other advice would be warmly received.

Hi Everyone,

Can we just update a date value in a hidden field(Front end) into the Symphony
table where that particular field is a datetime field from a custom
extension(Event in the extension) in the following manner without converting
value into a datetime value explicitly ?

$entry->setData($field['id'], array(  
'handle' => Lang::createHandle($value),  
'value' => $value  
)  
);

@jean-luc to get the answer to your question, the only thing to be done is to
try it in a DEV setup. But the numbers of SQL queries you are seeing are OK.
You could also try to use the cacheabledatasource extension to cache this DS

____

@nimanthaharshana the columns for the date field are not handle and value:
it's date and value

____

check the processRawFieldData() method in field.date.php

@jean-luc @nitriques association field doesn't work with cacheable datasource

Better to use datasource chaining with cacheable datasource

Yeah good point

____

just saw  "he problem is that this extension retrieves and sets XML on the
DataSourcePreExecute delegate"

____

that was the problem of subsection manager

@nitriques Is there any straightforward way of updating a field without
knowing the type of the field ?

I am pretty happy that I did not do that in ERF

____

@nimanthaharshana no because each field has it own schema

____

you would need to use FieldManager::fetch() to get the field 's type
dymanically

Thanks of the replies above @nitriques @wdebusschere

  * I've tried the cacheabledatasource but that didn't help
  * it's odd because if I re-save the entry, the DS load time drops from 2.0280s down to 0.0185s. Is there any way to force all entries to re-save as if they'd been saved via the admin interface?

I'm making the assumption that it's the **association_field** because if I
comment out `public $dsParamINCLUDEDASSOCIATIONS = array(...)` in the DS it
loads at expected speed.

<http://symphonyextensions.com/extensions/resave_entries/> but I do not know
if it still works (try it in a DEV setup, or make a db backup before)
