I wonder if the date/time field would solve your issue I think it would work
the way you want it to. I'll see if I can try it out.

Date time works the same just tried it in the backend

What you could do otherwise, is add some javascript in the backend, and have
that change the date format once it’s not focused. (blur in jquery if not
mistaken)

That was I thinking of or the html5 date input, but that will be probably
broken for firefox and safari

If I read this
<https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/blob/master/symphony/lib/toolkit/fields/field.date.php#L160>

I would think the field is supporting only a year and even only a year and
month. Or am I wrong (again :-))?

it’s mainly used for the filters though, and for the publish panel if there is
a pre-populate date

____

not on save

____

but that would do what you’d expect it to

Ok understand it. I m on my way for an hour now and would look if the same can
achieve on save

Ok, if i change this
<https://github.com/moretaste/symphony-2/blob/d4565bb8ff55b0d60ee60584304d5da2b3a4019b/symphony/lib/toolkit/fields/field.date.php#L537>

It works for me as I expect

____

Why is the prepopulate date treated different?

because the prepopulate date is the same date used in filters.

____

so you can filter by year, you’d want the year to be pre-populated not epoch
time

ah ok. So all we need is an option in the backend to choose handle date as
epoch or not as epoch?

@moretaste all dates are always relative to the epoch
