@nitriques, I try to wrap my mind around #2814 and #2815. But I don't get it.
#2814 is supposed to be merged in Symphony 3.0.x, while #2815 is supposed to
be pulled into Symphony 2.7.x. How is the relation between this PRs? Should
#2815 be added to Sym 3 as well? Or is it just different things for Sym 2 and
Sym 3? Can you help me understand this?

Hi all,

I'm getting this error when I try to save an entry for a section where that
section has a "Reflection Field" =>

Symphony Warning: DOMDocument::loadXML(): xmlParseEntityRef: no name in
Entity, line: 9

An error occurred in
/var/www/MYSITE/extensions/reflectionfield/extension.driver.php around line 91

Can someone please explain me why this is happening and is there any solution
for this ?

RE. my above question,  
The syntax that I'm using for the Reflection Field => {//entry/first-name}
{//entry/last-name}  
Symphony version => 2.7.4  
Reflection Field Extension version => 2.0.3

Also please note that, the exact same thing is working on another site which
has,  
Symphony version => 2.7.4  
Reflection Field Extension version => 2.0.3

@Huttch Have you tried wrapping the JS in CDATA in your template? Then escape
for XSLT values. e.g.  
`<script><![CDATA[var foo = ]]><xsl:value-of select="//params/url-foo"
/><![CDATA[;]]></script>`

@cylkee now its wrapping the contents of: <script>window.location = '/' \+
state + '/?hash=' \+ urlHash + '&id=' \+ urlID + '&crypt=' \+
urlCrypt;</script> in CDATA tags -> <script><![CDATA[window.location = '/' \+
state + '/?hash=' \+ urlHash + '&id=' \+ urlID + '&crypt=' \+
urlCrypt;]]></script>

@Huttch Not sure then. What's in your `<xsl:output ... />`?

@michael-e #2815 definitely needs to be in 3.0.x too. As of right now, it's
treated as a security issue that requires another release of Symphony 2.7.x

The other PR, since it's modifying a behavior of the Author type will only get
merged in 3.0.x
