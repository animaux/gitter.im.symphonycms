HI laurentiu! You could build anything with Symphony

Hola

____

Anyone use PHP Storm?

____

I 've been using it at work and have been particularly impressed with the
XDebug integration. It's been interesting to run Symphony through it

____

I 've been pushing some commits to the `integration` branch as I fix things it
finds

____

Now that Symphony uses autoloading, my long goal is break the system down into
components, replacing them where possible with better supported alternatives
(whatever it may be). Short term this will likely be a reorganisation of
classes to make use of PSR-4

____

Mid term, I want Symphony to be installable by command line as I believe this
is the first step to introducing it into a CI environment (and makes scripting
installation via containers simpler too)

That means that as parts of the system are broken down into components, they
can be introduced with tests to help increase our confidence in the codebase
and reduce the risk of regressions

____

Where possible, I 'll do things in a backwards compatible way, but knowing
that some of the decisions in the codebase are over 10 years old, I won't let
it hold me back

Some components I've identified:

  * Delegate system replaced with an Event Dispatcher
  * Dependency Injection component introduced
  * Configuration enhanced to better support environment variables and to be exposed via DI
  * XSLT Processor broken out as a component (would allow devs to use the XSLT2 processor mentioned on the forum too) - this would be a stepping stone to a fully generic templating system

Jup :)

____

»hide/show fields« based on other fields’ values?

____

Maybe it should be split into two extensions?

____

But that’s likely even more work then …

____

But that makes the interface quite complicated.

The filter-part would be rather easy UI-wise.

____

The other too maybe …

____

*thinking* 

____

A `filters-array` does not apply if a `condition`is not set first, does it?

That would make it complicated to use filtering for all entrys in a specific
section. And makes me think even more that filtering and conditional fields
should be separate extensions,
