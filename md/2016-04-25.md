Looks like your apache is missing some mimetype?

__ __

I've never seen something like that

__ __

And since / is appended to the url, i fear that the file does not exists (
because this redirect rule only applies to -!f requests (i.e. Not a file)

After testing, and verifying existence, `.ttff` will work, and if I rename the
`.svg` to the `.ttf` it fails too

__ __

There is no rule for `.ttff` and it loads fine. To my knowledge there is no
rule for `.ttf`

apache 2

__ __

and yah, all files are same permissions

__ __

otherwise I wouldn’t be able to pull one up and not the other, it’s a routing
issue of some kind

Hum

__ __

And if you comment out everything in the .htaccess, does all static files
works ?

@michael-e email attachements seem to work; however as it is it doesn’t cater
for Symphony generated PDF’s/csv’s etc. I tended to have these generated on
the fly when using Symphony’s email sender.

a couple of questions:

  1. Any suggestion on structure to allow http requests? Maybe a check for filename existance then swap over to http? (possibly will be ineffective if there’s really nothing on that url.
  2. With the above method, I usually feed the filename using the desegnated `filename` attribute. Any idea how it would make sense to delineate such notation? Maybe the same way like we do for emails? Name &lt;attachment&gt;

Happy to put a PR for the above points

@kirkstrobeck so it's a right issue

__ __

please check the rights on the file

__ __

chmod and chown things to get everything the same

__ __

I can view all except `.eot` and `.ttf`

__ __

I just threw package in to test, its out now

__ __

oh wait, it just worked

__ __

must have been a caching issue after commenting out all htaccess

__ __

@nitriques do you know what `.htaccess` would cause this fail?

no: Like I said, everything as always worked for me

__ __

but I use Apache 2.2

__ __

try to chmod 777 * ?

__ __

it really looks like a server issue

@jonmifsud: I have a bad cold, so I will answer shortly. Please try with a
local file. You will see that it does set the filename attribute (because this
is a core functionality):

    
    
    Content-Type: application/pdf; name="order-112233.pdf"
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
    Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="order-112233.pdf"

I already do generate PDFs dynamically. I simply added an event filter, which
works like this:

    
    
    if (in_array('orders-save-pdf', $context['event']->eParamFILTERS)) {
        $dir_path = WORKSPACE . '/media/orders';
        if (!is_dir($dir_path)) {
            mkdir($dir_path, 0777, true);
        }
        $pdf_url = 'https://example.com/api/xsl-fo/orders/' . $context['entry_id'] . '/?access-token=1234';
        $pdf_path = $dir_path . '/bestellung-W1B' . $context['entry_id'] . '.pdf';
        file_put_contents($pdf_path, file_get_contents($pdf_url));
    }

That said, it would probably be really simple to make it work with HTTP URLs
directly. This line in `class.emailtemplate.php`:

    
    
    $atts_eval[] = DOCROOT . $this->evalXPath($att, false);

is the culprit. One might change it to only add the docroot if the attachment
path starts with a slash, for example.
