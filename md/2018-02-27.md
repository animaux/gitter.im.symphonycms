@wdebusschere Thanks. I know that execute function is the place, but I need to
attach a child element to the XML which is returned by the execute function
based on a calculation that involves the xml result. If I give you the steps

1) Get XML result via ===> $result = parent::execute($param_pool); in execute
function  
2) Then loop through the child elements of XML (Which I cannot do, due to the
"Private" encapsulation) and do the calculation  
3) Within above loop add the new XML element for each child element

Can you please help me on this ?

@nimanthaharshana You can loop through the $result (var_dump to see the
structure) and add the calculation values.

    foreach($result->getChildren() as $entries) {
    $newvalue = "100"; //or calculate
    $entries->appendChild(new XMLElement("blabla", $newvalue));
    }

@Huttch sorry, thought you were using the JIT extension, probably your png
gets resized?

@wdebusschere ah that was it, thanks, i totally overlooked that, is there
anyway to fix that so it keeps the background transparency on resize?

@Huttch Could be the symphonycms/jit_image_manipulation#99, otherwise JIT v2.x
is buggy. v1.4x good
