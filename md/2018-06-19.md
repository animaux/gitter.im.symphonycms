Hi All,

can someone please tell me how can I get entries(with Symphony classes) which
are associated to a particular entry ID ? As an example, say there's an entry
which has the ID `2` and there're some entries associated with this entry
(with the extension `Association field`), so I want to get all the associated
entry ID's of the entry ID 2

Simply add the association field to the DS output or params. Then filter this
DS by the ID of the mother entry.

@animaux Thanks for the response, but I want to do that in my own extension
with the code. Any idea how can I do a query?. I guess EntryManager should do
this task for me, but I'm not sure how to do that.

You could have a look in the `association_output`-extension’s code. Maybe
there are clues there.

@michael-e I get a blank page from the CSV-Import/Export-Extension in Symphony
2.7.7 on PHP7.2 (earlier versions too). Nothing in the logs, any idea where I
could look to fix this?

I’m coming across the same problem again just now …

Hi guys, it looks like in Symphony v2.7.x, field prepopulation stopped to
work. I have section entries filtered by an association field - through
clicking on an association count link from another's section publish index -
and when I want to create a new entry in that filtered section, the
association field is not prepopulated. Works fine in Symphony v2.6.11, after
update to now Symphony v2.7.7 it does not. Anyone can confirm?

`?prepopulate` seems to work fine with a text input in Symphony 2.7.7 on PHP
7.2.x in a quick test here.

____

Any JS-errors in the console maybe?

There was also a difference in Association Field extension versions - v2.0.2
on Sym v2.7.7 vs v2.0.1 on Sym v2.6.11 - but when I downgraded on Sym v2.7.7
to ext. v2.0.1, nothing has changed (well, the v2.0.1 extension is now marked
"red" in Extensions list because of Symphony compatibility version).

____

@animaux yes, `?prepopulate`, but for association field

____

No JS-errors

Ok, I see. Same here. Does not work.

____

That should be an issue for the association field.

____

Or the core … I dunno.

I remember there was some change in the core that made it neccessary for
fields to declare `canPrePopulate` —> see animaux/association_field@bedce23

____

That should do the trick.

____

For some unknown reason I never sent a PR. Did that just now.

Has anyone tried the `importcsv` extension with `2.7.7` yet?

@nitriques is it possible that one of the security fixes in `Symphony 2.7.7`
prevents the `importcsv`-extension from displaying its backend page? It looks
like the extension actually makes use of `xslt` in the backend, which I
haven’t seen in an extension before. However I cannot find any error anywhere
and it simply shows a blank page in the backend. Any ideas?

@animaux it should not. Blank page usually means a hidden/obscure php error
