Hmn, I get an `PHP Fatal error: Class 'Symphony' not found in …` after
updating a site from `2.3.2` to `2.7.2`. Any ideas where to look for the
troublemaker?

Am I right in assuming there once was a class called Symphony that is not

And an older extension tries to use that?

I have this now. But there is no distinction between the two sections. I know
you can make a distinction through `create-dealer[fields][name]` for example.
But that does not work because the first section doesn't validate with that
markup.

ok, but in a quick look these aren't posts in multiple sections

____

It is also a lack of knowledge for me about the ins and outs of php. But that
is for me just the thought why can we make sections and datasources with ease
and for an event we have to know about delegates, classes, php in general etc.

What I want to achieve now sounded so simple. A person linked to multiple
persons added in two sections by a front-end form with validation on required
fields and the right pattern for some of them (like email).

I have that somewhere that's for sure!

Yeah generated events are not design for this use case. they are like data
source: 1 section only

that 's why I often need to code some custom data sources (like to get data
from wordpress <https://gist.github.com/nitriques/9548145>) or events

for both you can replace the editor files in the assets folder with the newer
