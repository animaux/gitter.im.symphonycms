@nitriques morning! I’ve recently posted my [first extension-
attempt](https://github.com/animaux/are_you_sure) on github. It’s not showing
up on the extensions site. Shouldn’t it be in this
[list](http://symphonyextensions.com/developers/animaux/)?

I have a question regarding retrieving the ID of submitted entry using front
end event. Any pointers? I'm trying to grab the ID in order to generate a
barcode based on that ID to make it unique. then submit that base64 encoded
barcode string into a text area. I know there's probably a cleaner and safer
way to do it but Is the newly created entry ID available in the __trigger
function at all

____

    
    
      public function __trigger(){
        $this->post = $_POST;    
    
        $generatorPNG = new Picqer\Barcode\BarcodeGeneratorPNG();
        $_POST['fields']['barcode'] = 'data:image/png;base64,' . base64_encode($generatorPNG->getBarcode($_POST['fields']['email-address'], $generatorPNG::TYPE_CODE_128));    
    
        include(TOOLKIT . '/events/event.section.php');
    
        return $result;
    
    }

____

I wanted to use the entry ID rather than the email address, as there may be
duplicate email addresses being registered.

____

I 'm guessing the ID is available after the events.section.php file has run
it's course, but by that point the entry has been created right? Do I need to
resubmit the same form and update the entry instead?

____

Or am I overthinking this?

@animaux Can you sen me a screenshot of your profile please ?

____

@andrewminton try `var_dump($entry_id)` after your include ;)

____

or $result

____

or provide your own `__doIt` function

____

double submit is way hackier

so grab the ID from the $result array and pass it to the __doit function to
update the entry? var_dumping the $entry_id returned null after the include.
