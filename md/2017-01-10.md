Hi, does the `/install/` process update the database? I'm planning to go from
2.3.4 to 2.6.9. Specifically, my Git installation is a bit b0rked, so I'm
thinking about a fresh installation of 2.6.9 with the database from the old
2.3.4 installation. Is that going to work? Also the link to [2.6.9 release
notes](http://www.getsymphony.com/download/releases/version/2.6.9/) is empty.

yeah /install/ should update your database

but if you’re starting afresh - just make sure you have all your extensions
etc..

Thanks, @jonmifsud, that seemed to work okay. Yes, got all the extensions. The
install script made me create a temp database table prefix, which I then
changed to the correct table prefix. I ran `/install/` again for good measure,
although it said 'up to date'.

____

@nitriques There appears to be some version labelling discrepancies. I did a
`git clone git://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2.git target-directory` which
cloned what is labelled "Release 2.6.9", but in config.php it says 2.6.8. Also
the page is empty via the link to [2.6.9 release
notes](http://www.getsymphony.com/download/releases/version/2.6.9/) in
README.markdown.

Unrelated - has anyone ever dealt with the issue of raw Markdown output in the
`<excerpt>` element of the XML produced by the
[search_index](https://github.com/symphonists/search_index) extension? I
couldn't see any issues raised on Github about this so maybe I'm missing
something obvious? e.g.

    
    
    <search>
        <entry id="1234" section="example">
            <excerpt><p>&#8230; was ever thus. [The quick brown <strong>fox</strong>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_quick_brown_<strong>fox</strong>_jumps_over_the_lazy_dog) jumped over the lazy dog and that was that!&#8230;</p></excerpt>
        </entry>
    </search>

@cylkee `search_index` is only hardly kept alive by the community. Probably
best not to use the excerpt at all but use a DS filtered by the search result-
IDs and do whatever you want with that.

Thanks, @animaux. Yeah, so then I could use something like `substring-
before(@keywords)` to recreate a contextual excerpt. Are there any other
Search extensions? I can only find
[ElasticSearch](https://github.com/symphonists/elasticsearch) which appears
older and super complicated.

ElasticSearch is newer, but both extensions are originally by @nickdunn who
has abandoned all symphony extension development. There are no other working
search extensions I am aware of, sadly.

____

Not if `substring()`is the best approach. But there are some XML-utilities for
excerpts and truncartion, I think. I’m not sure if recreating the
functionality of the original excerpt-function is easy though.

____

I remember there was some discussion about problems with the excerpt. Will try
to find that.

Okay, I can leave the search thing for now, thanks.

@cylkee Thanks for the heads up: it's normal that your config.php still says
2.6.8 before you update. And the release notes page as not been created ..
working on this

@cylkee ElasticSearch is newer actually, though maybe the release is not as
frequently updated it’s far more powerful (though takes more time to setup
too)
