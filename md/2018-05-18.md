Quick question re. [import/export
csv](http://symphonyextensions.com/extensions/importcsv/)

CSV exports are delimited by a semicolon rather than a comma. This is no good
for my clients so I hack the extension each time so that it generates commas.

Is there a reason why the extension generates semicolons, not commas? I wonder
if this is designed-in or if it just hasn't been designed out? I LOVE commas
:-)

@stuartgpalmer both a considered ok to be a csv ! ;)

____

maybe we could add a setting for it

____

@michael-e @jonmifsud @nimanthaharshana I think the best way to fix it is to
detect the empty session without decoding it on PHP 7.0

Probably yes. Also because we should try to not break the session handling.

I 100% blame php on this. And they reverted to the old 5.6 behavior in 7.1 and
7.2

____

We NEVER broke it

____

they did

____

We fix the fact that we were saving empty session.. which made this bug appear
