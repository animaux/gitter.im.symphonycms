No one's had trouble with sorting by column header in the backend, have they?
a 2.6.1 installation isn't correctly/reliably sorting for me. Is it right that
'?sort=9&order=asc' is stripped from the URL after a sort header with that in
is clicked?

Check the manifest file is writable

____

Sorting values are stored in the manifest

____

and it’s intentional that the values are stripped from the URL

Ah, thanks. I reckon that's it as I also had trouble saving email config. It's
666 though. :/ Will look into it further.

It's 666 in a 777 directory. _scratches head_

____

(config.php that is)

____

Symphony also says it 's been successful in green at the top when I change the
email config, but the config file doesn't change.

I think there's something else at play here. It does eventually work if I keep
repeatedly clicking, but it can take approx. 15 tries.

The config file is updated on each click, so I need to check for server
caching issues.

____

Yeah, that 's probably it.

____

It 's on the same server as another PHP app.

If it is Zend, try and set `opcache.revalidate_freq=0` in your ini file. This
will make it revalidate the file modification time on every request (which
doesn't mean recompiling, so it's not a big performance issue).

Thanks. I've previously set APC settings similarly, but this is a newer
server.

opcache.validate_timestamps - setting that to 1

opcache.validate_timestamps=1 and opcache.revalidate_freq=0. php5-fpm and
webserver restarted, but no change yet. It would make a lot of sense if that
were the problem though.

____

I just tried opcache.enable=0 - still no change.

Hmmm. Have you tried writing to the config file, then waiting/reloading? If it
works after some time, it MUST be a chaching issue.

Just did. The change is reflected after several seconds.

____

I wondered if APC is installed too (I guess that might cause problems anyway),
but that doesn 't seem to be the case.

This really makes no sense to me. Can you verify that it is diabled, using
`phpinfo();`?

Now it 's working as intended.

That 's worrying. I always thought restarting php5-fpm, and maybe the
webserver too, was enough.

Aha. If you get a 302, you broke Symphony. It means that your browser attempts
to cache the page—which Symphony prevents, normally. You could only achieve
this by removing some of the (anti-)caching headers.

____

Have you manipulated headers in your webserver setup (Apche/nginx)?

The redirect is OK. For the final source you should get a 200 OK header.

Even when I hit return in the address bar to do a normal load, the reordering
is not presented. I'm pretty sure it's not HTTP caching-related.
