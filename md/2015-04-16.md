@moretaste does the entry load in the normal way by visiting without Search
Index? When I try to replicate my page breaks when I visit by directly
entering the page url without using search.

Sorry was putting the nbsp in the entry not the cached search data

    $entry = preg_replace("/&#?[a-z0-9]{2,8};/i","",$entry);

Ok finding how to do a code block, here we go

__ __

If you add the line above the into the data.search.php file just above this
line

__ __

    
    
    $excerpt = SearchIndex::parseExcerpt($keywords_highlight, $entry['data']);

__ __

then it will work I think. @nitriques is this an ok way to fix it?

__ __

Maybe there's an alternative to remove the html special chars as the search
index saves its data instead

I'm a bit out of depth here, I assume what's happened is that @moretaste got
nbsp in his database due to redactor then the Search Index caches chunks of
text for us to search and it copied the nbsp along with the other data. I use
Search index on some sites but with Markdown so nbsp didn't get into my data
so I never had the problem. So we need to stop html special chars getting into
tbl_search_index 'data' column. Or as I did above, stop it getting out once
it's there.

@munki-boy I do not think it is a valid fix.. we should try to find a way to
convert the html entities into valid utf-8.. something like
<http://php.net/html_entity_decode>

The question is: How does the Symphony core do it? I think we should do it the
same way. I hope that @brendo can shed some light on this.

All entries load in the normal way. As far as I can see is that the redactor
editor place the nbsp character sometimes at the begin of an entry. The index
function of search_index stores this also and the search_index output this
again. Totally agree with @munki-boy that or the nbsp can't be stored in the
database or that the output filter it out.

Thanks all by the way for the effort you show

Thanks @moretaste, I agree I think it isn't Search Index' fault, it assumes
data in database is already clean. Thanks too @nitriques I'll try
html_entity_decode instead for practice :)
