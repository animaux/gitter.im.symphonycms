@jonmifsud I totally understand the being-swamped-issue `:)`, not problem. For
me, the most irritating error ist this one:
mazedigital/association_ui_selector#59 Apart from that, is it still
possible/planned the `association_field` and it’s parent `selectbox_field`
will be united again?

oh that’s new! I didn’t realise that was ever an issue. Can you check if there
are any console errors when you search?

____

It _should_ be making a query to symphony my guess is that’s failing for some
reason and then its filtering with JS from the pre-loaded list

No problem :thumbsup: it COULD be a problem with my fork, will try to sort
that out too.

____

The problem popped up after some updates on existing sites. Clients where
suddenly not able to find entries that existed anymore.

____

Setting the limit to a high number always fixed the problem.

hmm do you know what was updated maybe? so I can see how to replicate. My
limit is generally 20; and got plenty of sections with more than 20 entries…
I’d have thought if it came up someone would have said something.

That’s what I was wondering about …

____

Ok, I have found a site now to replicate the error.

____

No JS errors in the console. Will try using the regular selector interface
instead of my UI fork.

____

In that case I updated symphony, I think. But it could have been coincedental.

Hmm, it looks like the problem could be in my fork. Will try to sort that out
tomorrow.

My fork really seems to behave differently. I wonder if we should find a
replacement for selectize.js which seems to be a PITA as far as I remember.
Even the updated version I had used in my fork still had some really annoying
qirks. Maybe we can find a way to go forward with both the selector and
editor, that we can both agree on. @jonmifsud

… and get rid of my superflous fork.

____

There are some useful changes, apart from the cosmetic ones, that I think we
could agree on. Will try to compile that and put it in an issue.
