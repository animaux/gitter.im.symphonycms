I'll try. I'm not sure I can do that. Do you think it may be the PHP version
causing this issue ?

@wdebusschere  
Just checked with another server where it has working sites and there seems to
be the same values for both `session.gc_probability` and `session.save_path`
in that server

When I dump the session token and xsrf token in the function
`validateToken($xsrf)` I get null for the session token and gets a value for
xsrf token. I guess this issue has something to do with sessions, but I can't
figure out why that's happening

Do I remember correctly that the website in question used TLS/SSL on the old
server and runs without encryption now?This might cause problems. (Especially
if the old server used to send an HSTS response header — I am not sure how
browsers behave Can you test with a different domain for the login?

____

…how browsers behave when the domain no longer uses SSL. (Theoretically, in
this case the browser should not connect at all. But you never know.)

Can you test with a different domain for the login?
