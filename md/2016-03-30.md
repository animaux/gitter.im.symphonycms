@nitriques I’ve just posted an issue on Github (symphonycms/symphony-2#2581)
relating to publish/date filtering. I’d really appreciate your feedback. Need
to setup a very particular filter in the backend for future dating. basically
something on the lines of `today to today + x days`

@jonmifsud oh! that looks promising. thanks man! I'll make some test, is that
in integration branch? out of curiosity, Symphony uses InnoDB?

@bernardodiasc yes it’s on Integration branch; I’d suggest to just copy that
line though as Integration has a bunch of breaking changes ready for `3.0`.
Symphony was (is ?) using MyIsam but InnoDB gives better performance overall
and the stumbling blocks for migration were removed from MySQL 5.5 (if not
mistaken) onwards when InnoDB started supporting full text indexing.

if you’re building new I suggest you stick to InnoDB (even if most extensions
will use MyIsam anyway)

@nitriques yup not so simple - I wonder if there are any downsides to
‘hacking’ it for a quick fix as client needs this done `yesterday` so would be
more than happy to test things out myself. But I don’t want to send up a PR
which breaks some other workflow I don’t think of.

@nitriques I’ll be heading off - getting late here. But if you manage to get
to it and have any ideas I’ll be happy to play around tomorrow.
