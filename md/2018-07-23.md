Guys, in Symphony backend, if I have in a section with e.g. 300 entries,
pagination per 50 and everything sorted by lets say a "yes" checkbox value,
how does the sorting works?

____

Because I get random entries per page, also repeated, that is an entry which
was on page one, is also on page two

____

The sort takes a second column value like ID? Or nothing?

____

Needless to say for the example, everything has a  "yes" value

____

So basically, when I paginate through the 300 entries, I do not see all of
them

Not that I’m aware of; I think we need a fix there to sort by entry_id as a
second value by default.

____

I’ve seen it happen a few times for me too

____

because the sort when the values are the same is non-deterministic

I just run into it now so wanted to check out first, but wasn't about to fix
it by myself, kind of high level for me, I am mostly frontend dev

I seem to be having an issue with Association Output extension on Symphony
2.7.7. Using Association Field 2.0.2 and Association Output 1.2.0. What I've
noticed is that when I 1) load the page and then refresh shortly after (within
5 seconds or so) or 2) load the page in one browser and shortly after load in
a different browser, the Association elements aren't included in the XML -
it's like the Association Output breaks.

[Example site](http://dev.shrimp.dj/mixes)

Here is the before

Here is the broken

Anyone had this issue before? I'm thinking I could bypass the issue using
browser caching but where I get worried is that it will be an issue if two
users access a page shortly after one another (which I think I simulated using
two different browsers which browser caching won't help).
