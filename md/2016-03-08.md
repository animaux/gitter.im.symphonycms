@michael-e hey, just posting the solution of my problem here, I have installed
MAMP with PHP7, just needed to set `session.auto_start = 1` in php.ini and
everything works fine. :)

@nitriques Nice. Show all what I would mostly need to see. In case you need
more detail you could always dive into the meta.xml

____

@bernardodiasc regarding `PHP7`there is some discussion further up this
thread. IF I remember right `Symphony 2.7` will be the first version to
support it.

____

By the way: is there a way to dump this entire gitter chat history in order to
archive it somewhere? Would be nice since there is a lot wisdom in it :)

@animaux my best bet would probably be their own API… they don’t seem to offer
an ‘export’ at this point. Very true that there is a lot of knowledge in here
and possibly not so easy to parse/understand as in the forum

Speaking of calendars.

____

Is there a way to output a calendar in Symphony? E. g. a datasource that
outputs all the days of a given month/year whatever?

____

I think `date and time` has some stuff, but not quite that?

____

There’s a datasource coming with it which is not really documented

____

Guess I have to ask  @nilshoerrmann

____

Ah nope it’s only `… a list of month and weekday names for each language
provided.`in the DS

@nitriques I have another suggestion regarding the extensions-site: It would
be nice if extensions that haven’t been touched in years get some kind of CSS-
patina. F. e. they could be slightly greyed out, or have a pattern in the
background in the index list.

____

This way you could instantly catch abandoned extensions with the eye.

@bernardodiasc: Thanks for reporting your solution to the session issue on PHP
7 (MAMP). However, I think that using `session.auto_start = 1` in your ini
file will start a session for every visitor, no matter if the visitor actually
needs a session — that contradicts the way Symphony is supposed to work. So
could you please post the issue [on
GitHub](https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/issues)?

____

@animaux, @jonmifsud: That EXSLT calendar is missing additional logic for leap
years, see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year#Algorithm>

the greyed out ones are the ‘major’ versions and do not specity the full

You can try this too. Add to your `.htaccess` this line: `php_value
auto_prepend_file "./prepend.php"`. In the same directory, create a new file
`prepend.php` with contents `<?php putenv('HTTP_HOST=customvalue');`. This
might help as it does not rely on environment variables from server, but it
lives only during the request.

____

Although if you have PHP safe mode enabled, it is possible that this wouldn 't
work either.

You might be running on CGI version rather than Apache, so you 'd then

Take this out from `.htaccess` and create `php.ini` with the same line :)

As a third alternative, you can modify the index.php and just put the

@jonmifsud: Yes, they probably mean that you should always use `$_SERVER`

Basically, the host says its a bad idea to use getenv in a framework because
it can only be setup on hosts which provide that variable to the environment.
Exactly the issue I ran into today.

I am curious what @nitriques has to say about this. Maybe we should always use
`$_SERVER`?

They responded to my response about y'all using setenv:

"Their feelings are wrong and not supported by the PHP developers.

But if they feel there is a problem with $_SERVER, they can file a bug report
at bugs.php.net, preferably with a patch demonstrating their proposed fix."

It's quite surprising to me that the environment variable is used, because
usually HTTP_HOST is passed through CGI. You can access these values with
`$_SERVER` superglobal, but not with `getenv()`.

Since the guy from my host is kind of taking part in this conversation through
me, gonna copy/paste a few more statements he posted:

____

"Passing server variables through the environment was cool in 1999 when CGI
was a thing, and web servers forked on every request and then forked again to
run the CGI.

These days, PHP rarely runs inside the web server, it runs in its own
dedicated process, so any presence of variables in the environment is a
compatibility shim for scripts time-traveling from 1999 that should not be
relied upon by current code."

____

"Of the two easiest (and therefore most common) ways of using PHP, one
(Apache+mod_php) still only works with the one-process=one-request model so it
populates the environment just like CGI used to do, and the other (FastCGI)
employs a compatibility shim like I described above. (Basically it has a
custom getenv that silently diverts to the list of server variables.)

No doubt the combo of those two does account for "most hosts" so that's
probably why they didn't notice it.

One wonders whether the PHP folks ought to kick an E_DEPRECATED warning when
getenv() is used that way for that reason."

Well they got removed from the compatible hosts list so if y'all end up
changing from getenv to $_SERVER should make sure they get re-added.

____

His position is that both ultimately come from the same source, it reads to
me,

That environment variables are set by compatibility shims that just read
$_SERVER.

Also it's not possible to run this from browser (header needs to be modified
and for instance Javascript does not let you change the host), and again this
is more of a poor server configuration (catch all required).
