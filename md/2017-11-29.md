@nitriques / @alexnantel88 by any chance did you or anyone try mysql Load
balancing with read replicas and Symphony before? Proposing it as a potential
change in infrastructure but I’m thinking I’ll need to recode part of the core
or create a new database driver.

hmm so with PDO that would be doable I guess?

I put it up on the client list suggestions for page speed. got a couple of
things higher up which I think are quick wins… given the development pace
lately might be a while to get to it since I have to do work on other items
too
