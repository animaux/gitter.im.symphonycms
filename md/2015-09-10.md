@nitriques no problem :) but I think I know how to get around it. it’s a kind
of pro bono so it will wait a bit.

ah :)

__ __

that makes things simple :) I should have had a fix on one of my branches ( I
think there’s a PR on it)

__ __

if that doesn’t solve it can I have more details on how to replicate. ( should
have commented in github ) because on all the pages I have it’s working just
fine. Had an issue where an entry was being ‘reset to position 0’ but last
release should have fixed all these issues.
