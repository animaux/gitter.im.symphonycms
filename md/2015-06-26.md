the problem is/was the $root parameter in the remote datasource when I change
that to the full path the importer seems to work (except some trim() error at
the import

jit will cache the image. So if I call an external image it is only one
request to the external image?

datasource chaining is not working with remote datasource. So I have a section
which outputs a ds param in the pool (`ds-something.ObjectSystemID`) and I put
that param in the xpath of the remote datasource (`Object[ObjectSystemID=
'{$ds-something.ObjectSystemID}']`].

Result no records found.

do they run in the correct order? maybe the dependencies are not working
properly. if DS2 goes before DS1 it will be blank.. also when debugging the
param appears in the xml right?

the params are in the debug. How can I change the order datasources are
executed?

usually when you use a ds parameter it adds the datasource in a dependency
array.- look for `$this->_dependencies = array();` in your datasource

____

if that’s blank there is no dependency being saved ( which might be a bug )

____

if it’s blank just adde the dependencies in the array eg:`'$ds-
articles.images',`

in the datasource with the param or the remote datasource? Ok let me try

the one where you need to use the parameter. so I think the remote ds

____

but `$this->_dependencies = array();` was empty in remote datasource but
logical because you can't input any datasource filter

ah possible. I would think it should pick up the variables from the xpath

____

but I might be overthinking it

____

keep it in mind in case you never edit the datasource through the editor…
because it might remove them

yup

____

wow happy now. So I only import the data in a section which I will use as
filter for the remote datasource and the remote datasource now only gives the
filtered objects

____

I can 't think of a symphony life without Jonathan :-). thank you again

____

last thing to try is pagination

there’s always a way around it. I couldn’t help much because I happened to be
a bit overloaded this week.

no problem. But at first it looks like that it would't or couldn't work the
way I thought. And totally agree that there is always a way around

sometimes it looks like that. figured out more complicated stuff with Symphony
it was mainly because I couldn’t get time to look into it right away. Anyway
if you need anything should be around.
