hi, I was too busy to chitchat here ;-) But I've got a question about the
improved remote datasource

____

Can I filter now with page params and/or url params?

filtering meaning from the included elements? What I recall Brendan asked me
to test was datasource parameters.

____

but if you use included elements you can theoretically chain and filter. but I
didn’t try that out

it should work when using xpath to select what is going to be filtered. and I
think you could also include those within the URL. Not sure if anyone who’s
tried it can reply, @brendo is travelling so I doubt he can follow up.

I have to download the xml file in a zip format. Target now is to use that xml
instead of import all the fields, so I hope that with the filtering in the
remote datasource I could handle it

____

I think I understand the parameter in the remote datasource completely wrong.
It is to generate parameters?

It is possible in theory but it’s very memory intensive as the whole XML dom
is loaded in memory

____

you can try to modify `included elements` and set it to something like

    
    
    /ObjectenLijst/Object[somefield="{$url-filter}”]

but that won’t improve your memory consumption by much as all of the dom is
loaded into memory anyway prior to filtering.

Yup I did that but I've got probably 5 or 6 url params . So the xpath gonna be
a mesh

I’d go for XML Importer at this stage. it’s probably more robust for what you
want anyway. The only problem is that you’ll want to ‘remove’ / update entries
each time you have a new XML source file

I do the xml importer on the old website. It works, but the source got around
200 items per object and I like to use most of them for the new website

quite a lot of fields to cater for… If you don’t use too many maybe you could
look at “Dynamic Text Group” and use it for key-value storage and you could
put most of the non-important stuff there - though you’d still have to
configure the importer I think
