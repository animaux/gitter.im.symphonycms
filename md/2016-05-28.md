two places

the php logs (not symphony) would be elsewhere though

____

depends on the mamp setup

i am trying to add custom image effect from a great php class
<https://github.com/claviska/SimpleImage> so people can had effects (like
blur/sepia/grayscale)

but JIT is a quite complicated extension ^^

ah it’s not a simple task what you are trying to do. I think the ‘easiest’ way
is to add a ‘new’ mode

i discovered the hidden mode 5

____

practices

yes usually you would work on a ‘new’ branch especially if you intend to ask
for it to be ‘merged’ into the main JIT repository

anything

ok so just create a branch `git branch effects` for example and then commit on
that branch

ok thanks

____

i am pretty sure my code wont be good enough to be merged but well, let s try
to do at least something working

____

^^

____

i have modified JIT in the past to merge resulted image with a png mask, but
it was before its complicated (before the recipes in fact)

it s strange I thought the filter resize and crop was resizing then cropping
what is out of the dimension. But it seems there is a bug somewhere and it
just crops

sorry, i am wrong i was looking for resize to fit

____

everything fine

____

in fact no, not fine

____

resize to fit, resize the smallest size defined, keeping the ratio. Resize and
crop should resize, and no it doesn 't

____

it just crops
