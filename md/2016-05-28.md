ah ok :) for next time easiest way to look is in your php logs.

or the symphony logs `/manifest/logs/main`it would usually log in one of the
two places

the php logs (not symphony) would be elsewhere though

depends on the mamp setup

i am trying to add custom image effect from a great php class
<https://github.com/claviska/SimpleImage> so people can had effects (like
blur/sepia/grayscale)

but JIT is a quite complicated extension ^^

ah it’s not a simple task what you are trying to do. I think the ‘easiest’ way
is to add a ‘new’ mode

practices

yes usually you would work on a ‘new’ branch especially if you intend to ask
for it to be ‘merged’ into the main JIT repository

i have forked JIT and add the class as a submodule for now, but didn't commit
anything

ok so just create a branch `git branch effects` for example and then commit on
that branch

ok thanks

__ __

i am pretty sure my code wont be good enough to be merged but well, let s try
to do at least something working

__ __

^^

__ __

i have modified JIT in the past to merge resulted image with a png mask, but
it was before its complicated (before the recipes in fact)

if it’s something that works I’m sure we can get someone to clean it up.

it s strange I thought the filter resize and crop was resizing then cropping
what is out of the dimension. But it seems there is a bug somewhere and it
just crops

sorry, i am wrong i was looking for resize to fit

__ __

everything fine

__ __

in fact no, not fine

__ __

resize to fit, resize the smallest size defined, keeping the ratio. Resize and
crop should resize, and no it doesn't

__ __

it just crops
