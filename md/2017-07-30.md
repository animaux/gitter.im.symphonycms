@diomed a full-blown training series with a bundled theme has been on my
`would like to do` list for a very long time. but I donâ€™t have many projects
which I can break-down and do them in reverse so Iâ€™d have to find time for
something specific - since I committed to volunteering in our local community
timeâ€™s been hard to find. Iâ€™ve even considered making a paid-for advanced
course but not even time to potentially structure that Iâ€™ve found.

PS. currently weâ€™re building WebApps with Symphony which is particularly fun

Time's a myth. I've been looking for time for over a decade and it eludes me
at every corner

last happened in 2014 if not mistaken. Iâ€™m open/keen on hosting one but being
based in Malta - seems that might be difficult for the likes of @nitriques to
make it.

likely for others outside of Europe too, given youâ€™d need to connect at least
through a major european hub.

Ideally I donâ€™t want to hold it for only 5 people to turn up.

unless it was Australia Iâ€™d guess - which I guess happened in the past with
@brendo and @allen being both based there and most of the core team located in
Australia.

Iâ€™m open to travelling - just got this year and next year riddled with
volunteer related travelâ€¦ which takes up most of my not so free time haha.

@diomed You are right, I think we can create this all together very fast, we
just need to agree on the functionalities / sections / datasource naming /
extensions / frontend framework .. maybe we start with suggestion
functionalities, sections: graphviz?

@diomed yep had committed to this volunteering role for roughly 3 years kinda
dragged into it - though I enjoy it. I really wish I could give more here as
Iâ€™ve been given plenty.
