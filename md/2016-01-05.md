actually it was related to a request Ellie had made regarding memberships &
email validation/confirmation on update. But I think we’ll go around it in

All right. I have been working hard to update all websites to 2.6.x (the
biggest one still in the works), that's why I haven't been around for a while.

AFK now, see you later.
