Guys. Are there any security tips for Symphony? Best practices to make a
system most safe? (e. g. Permissions, PHP-Version?). I guess the permissions
should still be set up like in the oldish tutorials?

____

In terms of PHP, `5.6` is probably the safest option currently?

Best permission settings depend on the environment. Especially: How many users
have to work with the files? Often there is one user for Apache/PHP, another
one for FTP(S) or SSH/SFTP, used by the developer. But I have also seen
servers using the same user for both — in this case permissions can be
stricter. Ideally a file should only be writable for the users who need to
write to it, and only be readable by users who need to read it.  
So there is nothing like _the best permission settings_ , it really depends.

Of course! That's UNIX/LINUX multi-user logic! :-) Should I give you an
example? (It's impossible to list all the variants.)

Here is one example.

Assume that you have two users on the server:

  * Apache/PHP is user `www-data`, belonging to group `www-data`
  * Developer is user `michael-e`, belonging to group `www-data`

Now most of the directories and files (`index.php`, `extensions`, `symphony` —
recursive, of course) must be readable and writeable by the developer, but
Symphony (Apache/PHP) only needs to read them. So as a general rule we have:

  * directories: owner `michael-e`, group `www-data`, permissions `0750`
  * files: owner `michael-e`, group `www-data`, permissions `0640`

(Note that directories must be executable, PHP files should not be.)

Of course there are some special directories resp. files which need to be
written by both users:

  * `.htaccess`
  * `manifest`
  * `workspace`

For these we use:

  * directories: owner `www-data`, group `www-data`, permissions `0770`
  * files: owner `www-data`, group `www-data`, permissions `0660`

(Remember that in Symphony's config file you must set `0770`/`0660`
permissions as well.)

I hope that helps.

(It's maybe a bit neurotic to limit readability to user and group only,
because just _reading_ files is not a big deal. So one might use `5` as the
last digit for the above permissions — which means that the "world", i.e. all
other users, may read the files — without compromising security too much.)

Thanks for summing that up.

____

My usual setup with all-inkl.com is to have the FTP-User as the owner of all
files. Symphony aka PHP accesses files via CGI. Works fine, but sometimes I
feel like it could be a security problem.

____

all-inkl does not let me set up groups too.

____

But I’m not sure if permissions apply the same way to the PHP-User and the
FTP-User. Will have to try and find out.

I think it’s more about who has access to what files. Most ‘shared’ systems
give you one users for php/ftp access it’s their way of securing you from
modifying stuff for other users

The most precious file would be the config then, I guess. Since it has
credentials for SQL

yes in that case you want to make sure that the files are not readable by
other users.

It’s the first time I have a site that actually contains sensitive data that
is not visible on the page anyway. :·)

It's all about _who_ may do _what_. Just imagine someone breaks into the
server either being a different user/group or being the PHP/Symphony user.
What can you do to limit potential damage? For example, PHP must be able to
read the config, but who else? (BTW, no big need to worry about the
"developer" user, you would be lost anyway...) I can't say much more than
that, because I never worked with all-inkl.
