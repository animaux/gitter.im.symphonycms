Hi @kashif1993 I think you’ve got the wrong site/chat as far as I’m aware
Symhony does not support SQLite

____

and in either case even 17secs is too long…

@kashif1993 \- Are you talking about [Symfony PHP
Framework](https://symfony.com/) or [Symphony CMS](http://getsymphony.com)?
They are too different things. As @jonmifsud stated, Symphony CMS (which is
this Gitter Chat) does not support SQLite. Never has. Only MySQL/MariaDB. If
you are looking for Symfony PHP Framework, their [community
site](https://symfony.com/community), will be far more useful to you.
