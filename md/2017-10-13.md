@nitriques Can you please give me some examples for $entry->setData(); with
different field types?( Date, Input and other). I'd like to update data from
my extension with the most efficient and appropriate way. Please can you help
me ? :-)

Woah missed so much of this conversation - @stuartgpalmer was great to meet
and discuss. Agreed that the website needs an uplift and some documentation
love. Re symposium I’m waiting for some events / dates which should be out in
the next couple of weeks so I can more or less finalize my calendar for next
year. Then I can possibly suggest dates where I could potentially be the host.

____

@nimanthaharshana set data varies. most commonly you will need to input an
‘array’ - I tend to prefer using `checkPostData`  
and `setDataFromPost` \- it allows you to put/set data the same way you would
in a POST request. it handles converting the data eg for a “value” they would
also generate the handle etc.

____

it’s kind of an abstracted level, also setData uses post ids where as with
setDataFromPost you would use the field names as array keys which is far
easier to follow/understand without requiring additional documentaiton so that
someone can follow what you’re trying to do

@jonmifsud Thank you very much for helping !! :-) It's bit hard to get into
Symphony Extension development without knowing the architecture and other
facts. If there was a proper documentation this would become easier. Anyway,
Thank you very much !! :-)

Hi All,  
I'm having a problem updating a field via $entry->setData($field['id'],
$cols); Actually this sets the data correctly and commit is running without
issues, but it's not updating the entry. The same code is working on local
while this is not working on server. Any idea ?

Sorry. Problem solved. There was a mistake in field values (Values were
swapped). Thanks !.

Great @nimanthaharshana !

____

I suggest to read the API and then search the function by name in the code
source to see example
