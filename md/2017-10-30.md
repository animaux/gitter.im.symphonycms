How do other Symphonists deal with multiple country content? (Not
multilingual). E.g a site I'm building needs NZ, AU, and USA variations of
content. My usual way of doing this is to create tabs for each country and
duplicate the fields. But duplicating fields is never ideal, it's slow and
making changes later is time consuming. Does anyone have a more seamless
approach with out duplication?

There could be multiple types of content too: images, copy, video etc.
