Hey there â€“ I'm trying to use the XML Importer Extension (integration branch)
with @jonmifsud's patch
<https://github.com/symphonists/xmlimporter/pull/40/commits> to add support
for updating entries using Entry ID.

Am getting this error `Call to a member function get() on array`
xmlimporter/lib/class.xmlimporter.php around line 276

Could anyone give me a steer on a workaround?
