@tiloschroeder for me »Du« is always uppercase, in case you want to be polite.
Maybe I’m old `:)`

Als Anrede zumindest.

@tiloschroeder Du may be written small all the times and it should be when not
speaking directly to someone, as in a book (fiction). When talking personally
to someone, Du may be written with a capital D – and Duden reccomends to do
so. A website and especially an email is, in my eyes, a direct contact and I
would thus write Du with capital D.

+1 — Uppercase is more "polite", and I would prefer it on websites and in
emails. Unfortunately my "big system" is a complete and utter failure in this
respect, and fixing it will mean a lot of work. I **must** try and remember
that client discussion to find the culprit… At least I need someone to blame.

Hmmm. Facebook and Twitter alike use the lowercase "du" on the website.
However, I was told that Twitter uses uppercase "Du" in emails.

thanks for the feedback, @animaux, @mprofitl and @michael-e :smile:  
@animaux , you can also be polite if you write "du" small. To make it more
clear: It's about automated notifications on websites and in emails. And in my
opinion, users know thats are machine to human notifications.  
@michael-e funny the style in the Twitter app (under notifications):

  * xyz und 5 weitere folgen **dir** jetzt
  * xyz gefällt **Dein** Tweet
  * xyz gefällt eine Antwort an **dich**
