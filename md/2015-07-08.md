Hey guys not sure if anyone is around - but did someone ever encounter a 403
error when a url parameter contained %5C?(backslash if not mistaken)

I tried with 2.6.2, and I can't break it using backslashes or %5C. A 403 error
would be strange anyway. Can you reproduce the error? Do you have step-by-step
instructions?

Not sure yet I haven’t really looked much into it yet. Had someone going
through Webmaster tools and they noticed a bunch of links from a third party
site were throwing 403s… site is serving a blank page frontend, which seems
strange. Probably it’s something to do with server setup from the sysadmin
doubt an extension is throwing a 403...

Yes. It might, for example, be a server security module that tries to prevent
Cross Site Scripting. I doubt it's Symphony. So I would talk to the sysadmin
first.

yeah certainly not Symphony! got a replica ngnix server locally with the site
just now - works perfectly fine… (should use more or less the same config)

____

my guess is that they have a varnish cache… I’ll be doing more testing will
let you know if I isolate / find the issue in case someone comes across it

____

confirmed jumped varnish with the hosts file. Unfortunatly I have to wait for
Sysadmin to give the next step as I’m not very Varnish fluent..
