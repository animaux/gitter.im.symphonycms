I’m not sure if it was just the Repo; or there was some other code doing magic

____

would be good to know since I’m very likely to move forward with the Factory
stuff for the Main Site

____

getting a couple of hands on deck (through interns) to put in a team effort.

yeah I guess just wondering how it’s generating it.

____

so I can see the logic used; and how we can do it within whatever we build.
rather than re-inventing the wheel. Though we can get that imported via
Symphony and the markdown formatters available if needed too. (giving a new
methodology of ‘data storage’) for those who prefer keeping content in git
etc.

Owl gets too buggy for me

but still only images and overlay is with data attributes. I prefer my own
mark up

____

Mmm the bug I have is due to flexbox wrapper I think, maybe I can fix that
with only css

____

meh I already hate sliders but clients :D
