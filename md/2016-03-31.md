<http://symphonyextensions.com/extensions/publishnotesfield/> before. Nice!

I think I'll delete the DNS records since it points to a unused server

I’m not sure if it was just the Repo; or there was some other code doing magic

__ __

would be good to know since I’m very likely to move forward with the Factory
stuff for the Main Site

__ __

getting a couple of hands on deck (through interns) to put in a team effort.

yeah I guess just wondering how it’s generating it.

__ __

so I can see the logic used; and how we can do it within whatever we build.
rather than re-inventing the wheel. Though we can get that imported via
Symphony and the markdown formatters available if needed too. (giving a new
methodology of ‘data storage’) for those who prefer keeping content in git
etc.

any suggestion for an alternative for <http://www.owlcarousel.owlgraphic.com/>
Owl gets too buggy for me

but still only images and overlay is with data attributes. I prefer my own
mark up

__ __

Mmm the bug I have is due to flexbox wrapper I think, maybe I can fix that
with only css

__ __

meh I already hate sliders but clients :D
