Hi All. I am trying to do the following and would appreciate any advice as to
the best way forward.

I need to call a URL via cron which:

  * Loads a datasource of applicants based on a certain criteria
  * Sends an email to each applicant
  * Updates each entry to reflect that they have received an email

This is being used to send out reminder emails to applicants who are nearing
the application deadline.

How many applicants?

Hi Michael. There may be up to 300 or so applicants to email, though its more
likely to be around 100. I guess if its a cron process, the datasource could
be paginated and filtered to exclude those already reminded, so it could be
done in batches. In development we are using Sparkpost to send emails and on
the production server we'll be using an SMTP service provided by the client.

I am afraid that this will be rather complicated. But if you manage to define
the recipients in Email Newsletter Manager, you could start the newsletter
programatically (e.g. from an event).

@stuartgpalmer I would do a page with an event, that sends an email to ONE
applicants, and make the cron job more frequent

____

Your event could update a  "last checked" date field, in order to make sure to
process all applicants before starting over

I do not know why, maybe there is a problem with cloudflare... can you send a

And no, I do not have a twin (haha). Well, not that I am aware of

@nitriques that sounds like a good idea. The think is, in order to update the
record (to confirm they have had the email) I need to send data (e.g.
applicant ID) to the event. I normally do that via a form and post. I could
create a page which submits a form on load via javascript, but I'm not sure
that would get submitted via a cron page load.

Can you think of another way to initiate the event without using JS? Or do you
think JS might work? Thanks!

I just tested it on 10.12 and it works

____

The problem with no updating is that you are not getting security updates

____

It 's a pain in the ass to update (since it can crash your software) but from
a security stand point, you do not have the choice. It's not like Microsoft
which backports their security patches to all supported windows version

____

at least, the updates are now free

@animaux regarding the SSL issue, according to [SSL
Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=deuxhuithuit.com&s=104.25.251.23&hideResults=on)
your browser should be able to connect. Strange.

10.12 Safari works here too. Really seems to be a 10.9-issue.

____

We don’t want to jump on the creative cloud and 10.9 is still getting security
updates. Will have to jump to 10.12 soonish though since most of the stuff
from CS5/CS6 still works.

Our agency is mostly print, I am the sole web department :)
