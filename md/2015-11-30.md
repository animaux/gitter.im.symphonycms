I'm still struggling with the parent page parameters and the ajax page
parameters.

For example I've got the url
[domain.com/products/category](http://domain.com/products/category). This page
shows the ajax results for that category but also got all the other filter
options. So for this page I like to remove or disable the filter for category
based on the category parameter. But the ajax results is a page with his own
page parameters.

hmm can’t you pass whte cateory withing the ajax requests?

____

when that is set you do not show the form element (hidden) ?

the form uses url parameters that works. But the client likes to have also
separate product-category pages with the same form. The whole form and results
are the ajax page. So the ajax page doesn't know the parent page parameters

____

Only solution I can think of is write the page parameters into a js variable

a JS variable or into the form content, both should work if configured
properly.

____

usually for JS variables I would have a global param eg Sitename defined as an
object, and I add anything as properties of that main object.

It feels so hacky to put parameters (variables) into variables

____

and I have to replace some parts of the xslt templates into a js solution

____

mmm maybe multiple ajax pages

what I used to do at times (maybe it helps)

____

is use the same template/page

____

but add a url-param

____

`?ajax`

____

that would trigger another template (not master)

____

and if you have datasources which you don’t want you should be able to skip
them

I thought of that but that would mean I got urls like
[domain.com/products/category/?category](http://domain.com/products/category/?category).

redirect with htaccess?

____

but I still have the same problem than. The parent page loads with the url
param, not the ajax page/content

ok maybe I was not clear I use to do like this:

  1. Load [example.com/webpage/{param1}/](http://example.com/webpage/{param1}/)...
  2. Load any ajax components appending ?ajax to whatever url should load - If you have a fancy url structure and a change in param would change the url I would do [example.com/webpage/{$param1}/{$param2}/?ajax](http://example.com/webpage/{$param1}/{$param2}/?ajax) the AJAX part of the URL is just a variant to return a subset of the whole HTML (possibly skipping DS if applicable) making the pageload faster. any parameters would otherwise have to be passed via get/post to ensure that you keep the application status. Other viable options might be storing in localstorage or cookies (if they are not requried for rendering)

Ok, got it more now. (my thinking is slow the last days, because my sister in
law is deceased last week) But how do you load the ajax components. I think I
make there the mistake.

oh sorry to hear

____

so it’s a ‘mix’ really in some instances a page might have ‘multiple’ ajax
components.

____

usually the easiest would be to return an XML/HTML subset, and use the
standard jQuery selectors to do a plain replace.

____

either an id or a class, in some cases it might make sense to use a data-
attribute (maybe to mark with what it can be replaced)

Ok, I initially load the ajax content with:  
```

____

    
    
    $ (window).ready( function () {
      if ($('#selector')) {
        $.get('url-to-ajax-page, function(data) {
    
          var form = $(data).filter('#form-selector');
          var results = $(data).filter('#result-selector');
    
          $('#selector-form').html(form);
          $('#selector-result').html(results);
        });
      };
    });

so the only thing I have to do is grab a data-attribute (what I already set on
the body to identify the page depth) and use that as an extra parameter for
the ajax page ... and bam xsl:choose go and win

so you just need to figure out how to modify / add the data param to the get?

____

basically `url-to-ajax-page` \+ whatever is in your data-attribute
