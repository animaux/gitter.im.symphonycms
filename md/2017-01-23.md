In case it helps anyone, further to
<https://gitter.im/symphonycms/symphony-2?at=5874d300074f7be763b25976> and my
'upgrade' using a fresh installation of the latest Symphony version, but
connecting to an old version database (2.3.4): in `manifest/config.php`I had
to set `version` in the `symphony` array to be the old version number (`2.3.4`
in my case) so that `/install/` would run any required updates to the
database. Specifically, a `filter` column was added to `sym_sections` and all
fields' charset was converted to `utf8_unicode_ci` (can't remember the exact
wording). Otherwise I was getting a `Fatal Database Error: Unknown column
'filter' in 'field list'` on editing and creating sections.

@cylkee that makes sense when you use a ‘fresh install’ to upgrade you
shouldn’t be replacing your config as upgrade changes will not happen
otherwise

New puzzle: it used to be the case, on my old 2.3.4 installation, that I could
filter a DS by passing `-` via a Page parameter and the XML would list all
results for that param - I think I happened upon this as a way of achieving
the URL order I desired. Now `-` appears to be treated as no match. Has
something changed? e.g.

  * `/-/foo/` would not filter on the first param, but list all available results subject to `foo`
  * `/a/foo/` would filter for `a` on the first param, subject to `foo`
  * `/b/foo/` would filter for `b` on the first param, subject to `foo`  
Now, after my upgrade process mentioned earlier, the first URI example above
lists no results. In the DS filter field I've just got `{$param}`. Do I need
to do a fancy `sql: ...` query now for this type of scenario?

@cylkee I think that was a bug that got fixed. I was never meant to work that
way

the quick reply.

@cylkee if that’s what you want if you are ok with adding 2/3 custom likes of
code in your DS you can set it to work as you want it to

@jonmifsud This could save me a fair bit of time. Have you any pointers
please? Or could it be done with `sql: ...`? BTW, the filter field is a SBL.

        if (in_array($this->dsParamFILTERS['fieldid'], array('-'))){
            unset($this->dsParamFILTERS['fieldid']);
        }

____

replace field id with the field number and place in the beginning of your
execute function

you can replace in_array with `==` just happened to have that handy

oh my code is littered with stuff like this for certain projects…

____

(somewhat to a more complex level)

____

in particular anything to do with `preview` publish checkboxes and publish
dates… maybe thinking about it deserves a mini extension to alter the filters
prior to DS exectution...

Yes, very neat hack (after I deciphered what it was doing with my limited PHP
knowledge). Does the job. Many thanks, @jonmifsud.

Only trouble is, if I then edit the DS in the UI, it rewrites the execute
function. I guess that's a hazard of hacking. Do you not use the UI,
@jonmifsud? Or do you put a note on the UI side somehow to remind yourself not
to edit UI side?

there is an “is editable” function

____

change the return from `true` to `false` and you cannot edit it :)

____

if you need to edit - make notes of your custom changes; set it to true and
re-apply

Hey - not sure if this is the right place to ask, but does anyone know how to
change meta tags for an entire product category, without doing it for each
individual product?'

@nicolesimone_twitter sadly, it 100% depends on how the frontend template are
coded (see the xsl files in workspace/pages)

____

@michael-e I'd just found a section that was populated with a custom script I
wrote. Turns out I made a mistake and flooded the section with 8 millions
entries. 4Gb on disk. Symphony was able to merge duplicates and all pages were
still running ;)

OK, I think you won. I never had 8 millions entries. Even my "big system" has
only 170,000. :-(
