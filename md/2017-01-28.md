@uyimoses If you got a theme from themeforest I’d suggest following any given
instructions

____

most likely you’ll need to install from ZIP; because they’d also have packaged
your sections/database with it - otherwise it’s pretty much useless :)

parameters.yml -and that was all they specified - have emailed the developers
for a more detailed tutorial, but no response from same. Reason i’m here for

:) so you should be ready to go when you install a package like that no
changes needed (depending on how it was coded)

____

when I tried a simple one mine didn’t pass; my guess is it was too structured
for people to understand (or they wanted a more polished ui)

@jonmifsud I’ve followed the steps outlined and haven’t got a working
application. But can this be installed as a package on the Symphony CMS?

@uyimoses depends on the theme - I would think what you’ve got is a packaged
application. Which has a workspace etc; if it doesn’t work I’m afraid it’s the
theme owner who’s supposedly supporting you on that purchase. Unfortunately we
can’t be support for poorly packaged third-party products.

On themeforest usually you get a whole symphony cms which is themed.

Sadly, there are only a few of them available :disappointed:
