@bzerangue agreed that it takes time to maintain these things, and considering
the number of current contributors it seems pretty much on a premium.

@brendo the github docs they have a lot of things missing or is it simply
because it’s not the complete site?

@tachyondecay or @bernardodiasc would know. I think it was a complete copy of
the existing site, but not in the format they were shooting for

no I don’t think so. It doesn’t support ranges as far as I’m aware.

I think so, there might be some other subtile differences but I think that’s
the key difference at the moment.

re time format going to null, not sure never encountered it… and as for
community members maybe @brendo might have an idea if we track how many users
log in to the forums/site… but If you’re talking in terms of contributors at
this point I think it’s a fairly low number.

@moretaste Do you have an alternate language installed?

____

I seem to remember an extension that mistakenly cleared those values on
install/enable but can’t remember which

____

We have about 12,000 members, but I think active members would be in the low
100’s

many sites it powers.

Our biggest traffic is organic search, which is likely because we have a lot
of XSLT advice

makes sense. If people are looking at XSLT technically it shouldn’t be that
hard to tempt them once they have some knowledge.

@brendo I had an alternate language, it seems that was the troublemaker

____

not bad at all 1000 users a day who are interested in xslt and/or symphony

____

less activity on the forum could also mean that symphony just works perfectly
:-) and only minor problems

the latter would be nice but it’s hard to say. It could also mean that the
number of new users has drastically declined - very much doubt our
documentation is that awesome that nobody new needs to ask questions and/or
finds all the answers. seasoned users on the other hand wouldn’t have that
problem.

I recently look at processwire just out of curiousity. I liked the approach of
processwire to think everything is a page. It is almost the same approach I
use with symphony. But I didn't see any advantages above symphony.

The strength of symphony is that it is a toolbox and that is maybe also the
weakness. After installation there is nothing to see, while other cms systems
have a default lay-out and sample data. On the otherside that is exactly what
I dislike from most other cms systems that the developers has think out the
complete structure/fields etc.

Yes, unfortunately I think you’re correct

____

On the other hand, I think Symphony user’s generally seem to be pretty
switched on and friendly people

____

I think having such a clear focus like ‘we don’t do your frontend’ is
appealing to some

But I can see that being less popular these days where time is money

the re don’t do your front end is exactly why I find it pretty good.

people like me get in panic ... so what does your monolog saying? :D
