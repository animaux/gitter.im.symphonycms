OK good.

____

if you go into a datasource editor, and want to filter an ‘input’ field

____

it will match either the `handle` or the `value` \- so if you link that with a
url-parameter which is usually the handle your datasource should filter
accordingly

____

I believe there are a few tutorials on the site and on youtube whic hshould
cover this.

OK. So it'll filter on both handle and value right ? I searched this and had
no luck. I'll give it a try. Thank you so much !

ah ok - I thought you didn’t know how to input/try things. Yes by default it
will run the query on both handle and value.

unfortunately I don’t really know about any - there are very few good
extension developers which have published work. Your best bet is looking at
one of them

____

we’ve done quite a few but never got down to writing a guide/tutorial. If you
get stuck ask and if feasible we will try to guide you

I actually need the very basic concepts like plugin directory structure, what
are the base classes to use and that sort of things. If there's a guide for at
least these concepts please let me know. Thank you. My Email =>
