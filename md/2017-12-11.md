Ah, another way is to filter by `/data/events/event-
handle[@type='created']/@id`.

@michael-e is there a way to send an ETM-Mail to a dynamic list of recipients
from a DS? From the manual it looks like it needs to be a predefined list.

yes - but you need to pre-define your list/datasource before.

____

as in you can’t do the filters on the fly I think

____

but Michael might know better.

Thanks Jon, but how?

____

Like with a reflection field?

I believe that the lists are linked to sections and you can do the filters.

____

at least I’ve got filters coming in from my section - which has all users
-then I filter the ones which have `x` or `y` or by age group.

____

but your filters are pre-defined when you create the list

____

its like a datasource - but for ETM if I remember correctly

Hmn, not sure I can follow. Is this happening in PHP then?

no backend I believe.

I’ve got a meeting in a bit so I need to run but I can check-in later if
Michael doesn’t pitch in by then

Thanks, no worries!

____

My thought just now was to compile the list with a reflection field and just
grab it with regular XPath.

Hmm, if I understand the caption of the recipients field right it DOES iterate
over entries in a datasource. Will give it try.

But how can I filter a DS that is attached to an E-Mail template since page-
filters apparently do not apply?

You need a datasource and an XPath expression. I can't say much more without
knowing what you are trying to achieve. How would you like to filter the DS?

I think I managed to filter it properly thanks! So this was just another case
of me thinking out loud, sorry `:)`

Wasn’t there an extension around that was able to log whether a user has seen
an entry? Something to mark »read messages«?

____

A field I think.
