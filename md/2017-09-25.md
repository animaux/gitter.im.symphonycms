Are you using Symfonyt <https://symfony.com/> or Symphony CMS
<https://www.getsymphony.com/?>  
This site is Symphony CMS.

Have any of you experienced problems with JIT generated images including areas
of black such as this one?

![JIT image](https://asia-decs.com/image/1/300/0/uploads/media_partners_images

I can solve this by clearing the cache, but the problem keeps reappearing
periodically and I would love to know if there is a more permanent fix?

And another unrelated one... Has anyone developed a versioning extension for
Symphony entries? I spotted [Entry
Versions](http://symphonyextensions.com/extensions/entry_versions/) on the
extension site but it seems a bit half-baked.
