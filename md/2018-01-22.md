Hi All,

Can someone please advice me on multisite setup on Symphony?. I found this =>
<http://designprojectx.com/tutorials/ninja-domains-a-multi-domain-setup-using-
the-symphony-xslt-content-management-system/> , but if someone can direct me
with more details, I appreciate it a lot. Thanks !

@nimanthaharshana it’s fairly easy

____

build two sites into “subdirectories "

____

so `yourdomain.com/site1/` and `yourdomain.com/site2/`

____

then use the `.htaccess` or `nginx` rewrite depending on your setup to direct
the domain to site1 or site2

____

the rest of the directory / master structures are up to you. Usually in cases
like this we might have 2 or more master files.

I need some help with the Rest-Api, getting data works smoothly but http
posting data to for example /symphony/api/entries/articles gives me <filter
name="permission" status="failed">You are not authorised to perform this
action.</filter> I have added the auth-token in the url and as an hidden input
field.. but no success
