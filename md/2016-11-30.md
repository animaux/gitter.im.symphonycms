Is a rather simple output of 5655 entries with `map location field` lat/lng
data supposed to take 8.5s for the XML to be created?

____

I have trimmed down the output already to only include

    
    
         <entry id="627">
            <geo latitude="50.9802318997855" longitude="11.330360590274" />
        </entry>

I suspect there is a lot of pre-processing happening before the XML is
created, but I only understand the extensions’ code very little …

Judging from the profile output it is not the queries taking that much time.

____

The only oddity I can spot is `DataSourcePostExecute: association_output 15.76
MB`. Quite a lot of memory for `association_output` which should not be
involved in this DS at all. Hmmm.

____

Hmm, could be an error in the profiler … after deactivating
`association_output` the 15MB are correctly assigned to the slow DS.
