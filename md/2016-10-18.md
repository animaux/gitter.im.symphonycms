but is a frontend event that sets status to 'rejected'

__ __

yeap

__ __

since the events cannot do this

makes sense.

__ __

that said unless the ‘cost’ of not deleting them is ‘large’ I prefer to keep
things there. It helps in case a client want to ‘recover’ something they
delete. But what you say is doable I’ve never used the cron extension though

you're right

__ __

but in my case those entries have a zip field

__ __

that comes from a user upload form

I don’t know how the delete for the upload field works… but I guess your
concern is file size on server

if you delete from the backend does that remove the files?

well, as i can see, removing entries .. will auto unlink all the files

__ __

so setting a cron should have the same effect, right ?

depends on how you code it but I’d think so
