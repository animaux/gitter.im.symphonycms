makes sense.

____

that said unless the ‘cost’ of not deleting them is ‘large’ I prefer to keep
things there. It helps in case a client want to ‘recover’ something they
delete. But what you say is doable I’ve never used the cron extension though

you're right

____

____

that comes from a user upload form

I don’t know how the delete for the upload field works… but I guess your
concern is file size on server

if you delete from the backend does that remove the files?

well, as i can see, removing entries .. will auto unlink all the files

____

so setting a cron should have the same effect, right ?
