For those interested, I have started creating the Media Library extension I
mentioned a few days ago. <https://github.com/pixelninja/media_library>. A
work in progress, so watch this space.

@michael-e or anyone who’s pretty tight/familiar with memberships. We don’t
have any way to track tracability such as who’s created/made what changes to
which entries and when right?

No, we do not have this "out of the box". But for the basics (last saved
2017-07-24 11:13 by John Doe) all you need is two extra fields plus the
Default Event Values extension (if the entries in question get saved form the
frontend, that is).

I think I might just create an extension in that case. To keep historical
records at least as phase 1. I’ll see if I get approval for this.

@jonmifsud there are some older entry versioning extensions that should do
some of that. At least one of them should still work on current symphony
versions, not sure which one …

____

Maybe you could extend the tracker-extension for that?

@animaux possibly yes; I’ll need to have a deeper look and see where I want
the data stored. As I know some extensions used to keep the history saved on
_disk_ and not sure my infrastructure would be very flexible with that
especially as we’re working with some things which are practically SAAS based.

haha I know some extensions used to keep a JSON (or XML) formatted file in a
manifest directory to keep track of historical changes

____

or at least have the impression of that being the case.

____

as I potentially want these servers to operate on the cloud, I don’t want to
depend on a filesystem to get history

yes that’s my concern but I haven’t used any versioning for a while so it
might have changed.

Here in Quebec, we have 95% of our land that is wilderness.... the closest
village was 2:30 hour drive on dirt trails
