Sorry yes I meant they dropped 5.3 and still support 5.2 needed to sleep I
guess.

I moved the hosting for the trouble of them dropping php 5.3 on the quiet and
breaking the site. Next upgrade from Sym 2.2.5 >>>

@michael-e \- quick ETM question. If I have a number of recipients to which
I’m sending the email. Is there a way to identify the recipient from within
the template? Just want to add some kind of unsubscribe link, there’s no real
datasource I am using.

The email process basically knows the email address, in the `$etm-recipient`
parameter. You must filter a datasource with this parameter in order to get
more information about the recipient.

And I guess the variable is only usable from a data source not the template
right? In that case I just create a data source to output the email address.

I am not 100 percent sure, but I think it _might_ be available for the XSLT
processor as well. However, in this case you must use `$etm-recipient`.
`/data/params/etm-recipient` will not work (because the ETM does not add
parameters to the params XML). Give it a try!
