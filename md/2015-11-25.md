I've got a front end form from which I like to enter multiple options into an
association field. How can I do that?

I've tried `<input name="fields[producten]" type="hidden" value="[{$ds-
storage.prod}]" />` but that gives 0 without the square brackets only a single
options has been added.

@moretaste iirc, you'd use multiple fields on the front-end. the fields would
be named `fields[producten][]`, and their collective values would basically be
interpreted as an array when posted

@moretaste as @brockpetrie you’d have to use the array notation in the field
name. I’m not entirely sure if you can comma separate in the value attribute
but most certainly you can have multiple input fields like:

    
    
    <input name="fields[producten][]" type="hidden" value=“value1" />
    <input name="fields[producten][]" type="hidden" value=“value2" />

If I get

__ __

`Warning: Invalid callback XmltoJSON::handleXmlErrors, cannot access protected
method XmltoJSON::handleXmlErrors() in
D:\USBWebserver\root\extensions\apipage\extension.driver.php on line 156`

__ __

does that mean I have to give the file permissions?

no

__ __

it means`XmltoJSON->handleXmlErrors()` is type protected and cannot be used
outside of the XmltoJSON class.

__ __

to work you would need to have it ‘public'

__ __

not sure if this was like that or something you edited.

probably one was updated and the other wasn't

__ __

ideally find XmltoJSON class and make the function public

__ __

use of that functions shows there must be an error of some kind

`class XmltoJSON extends XmlToArray { public function parse() { return
json_encode(parent::parse()); } }`

__ __

can I just type public class ?

nope

__ __

you have to find `handleXmlErrors`

__ __

which in this case might be inherited from XMLToArray

__ __

you have to go down till you find it
