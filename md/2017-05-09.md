I’m still trying to do a frankenstein-extension called `unique-reflection-
field` :)

____

Thanks  @jonmifsud However, if I unterstand the code halfways, the
`reflection-field` seems to create the fields `value/handle` after
`checkPostFieldData` is called. Therefore `isHandleUnique` is not able to
chime in. I’m only guessing though …

I’m guessing the `compile(&$entry)`-stuff is needed to get a proper handle,
but that is called elsewhere, not in `checkPostFieldData`, where `unique-
input` seems to check for uniqueness.

Be careful with the reflection field. At the moment, the field is not updated
when an entry gets saved from the frontend, see symphonists/reflectionfield#27

____

This has to do with the `compile` function (and when it is called). It would
be better to fix this before extending the functionality even more.

____

Unfortunately I don 't have the time to care for this, and I don't use the
reflection field, BTW — I dropped this in favour of "hacked (custom) events".

I was able to invoke the filter and block entry creation, but checking fields
of existing data and comparing that with the entry currently trying to be
created was a bit too much. :see_no_evil:

Believe me, the Reflection Field is worse (as in: more complicated) than that.

I just did a quick test. Created and entry via frontend. Reflection field
seems to work.

Editing seems to work as well.

____

But the reflection field’s data is not changed by that. The fields creating
the value are untouched from frontend-editing (by design), so maybe that’s
where it breaks.

____

So actually that works for me, since the field does not need to be updated
when the entry is changed. :·)

OK then. But IMHO the Reflection Field needs some love. Before that, I
wouldn't use it as a basis for further development (as mentioned by you,
creating an even more complex extension).

True maybe. It seemed the path of least resistance for the moment.

____

Though the `compile()` function seems to be the Endgegner.

BTW, if all you need is a simple reflection, you might as well simply hack the
event's `load` function. :-)

A strange thing with my first steps with you custom event filter was that I
checked it and saved the event but it got unchecked after saving, even though
it seemed to be active. That creeped me out.

____

Good point! I think I actually did that for some kind of spam prevention once.
A very very long time ago.

____

But then I would still need to check for uniqueness with the gruesome
`EntryManager`?

The saving problem sounds like a typical provider issue, not setting the
"revalidate frequency" of PHP's OPcache to "0" (which is much better if you
change PHP files through a backend). If you save, then wait for some seconds,
then re-visit the event page, it should be there.

Indeed, uniqueness is an issue. It may get complicated, unless you make direct
query to the database table. Hmmm, there are a lot of ways to build security
issues…

AFK now. Will be back later.

Ok, thanks for your help!

____

Therefore an `unique-reflection-field` would be a nice way to handle things
outside the form/event stuff.

____

Hmmm. Isn’t [this
extension](http://symphonyextensions.com/extensions/uniqueindex/) doing
exactly what I need? How could I miss that?

Do you need the "reflection" functionality in the frontend only?
