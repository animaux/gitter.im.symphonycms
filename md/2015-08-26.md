@jonmifsud Actually I think it’s APC that should be updated a little so that
it returns creation/expiry information

____

This information is useful and being used right now for the Remote DS

____

As the expiry is added to the return XML

If you go to `{$root}/verein/`in the frontend and have a look at the debug-xml
you’ll find the order in it’s current state:
`/data/artikel/entry/reihenfolge/text()`, which is `3, 5, 4`

not for ordering. What I’m thinking is that I had made some modification to
support filtered order entry views. maybe that is having some impact on how it

yes your’re right. But the filters would have to match in frontend / backend.
That’s the way I set it up. Probably not documented properly. If you have a
filter on the frontend matching the field which you selected. It expects to
find an equal filter for the ordering

____

maybe I should make it default to the default order if none found, which makes
sense

the issue is that to use this special filtered order, you need to use the same
filter in the backend. I have custom links to the filtered sub-sections

Ok, I think a step-by-step instruction to make this work in the readme would
probaly suffice

I use the same section for my client to order 20 different types of content,
just filtered by content type. strucure is the same across.

____

yep

____

it should also support more complex filters, custom order for filter
combinations.

Ok, so it doesn’t work for me because I use the same DS for all types.

it could work, I think I have the same ds in some cases using a url param for
filter.

____

the thing is you would have to use a backend page which is filtered with the
exact same param

____

to create the distinct order not the main listing page

ah ok, but this particluar param is not available for the backend page

____

therefore it’s not working

yeah something like that. If you want I can try cook up a short screen cast to
explain in the coming page. it will make more sense once explained properly

I’d maybe rather concentrate on the readme. In order for people like me not to
make the same errors :)

____

Of course you could link a screencast there too. But I always feel external
things get lost over time …

____

Ok, will fix this on the live site now …

yeah that is a requirement, the screencast would be an extra. True I was
planning to do a series on advanced concepts but time is always a bit of a
restriction..

> maybe I should make it default to the default order if none found, which
makes sense

____

YES !

It 's the only thng I have to add to this conversation ! haha

AS for the wording, I do not have anything better to add, specially since my
maiden language is French ;)

@jonmifsud do you need to send a PR for this ? I'll test/merge anything you
post.
