@wdebusschere so you have a different field for each type of upload?

Hi there. I have two simple Symphony based websites, both 4 years old without
any changes, which need to be updated 2.3.6 -> 2.7.3. Most complicated thing
there is probably the Subsection manager, which needs to be replaced by its
successor (but there seems to be a way,
<https://github.com/symphonists/association_field/issues/3#issuecomment-52018015>).
I'm not used to Symphony development anymore, so would anyone like this
comparatively tiny job?

Both installs are Git repos, extensions are submodules... so it 's not super
messy, I think ;)

Hi, can someone please tell me how can I get the section ID from $context
variable when a new entry is created in backend?

@RepublicOfDave
<http://symphonyextensions.com/extensions/jit_image_manipulation/> I would
recommend the current version 1.47, not the pre-release version, see
<https://github.com/symphonycms/jit_image_manipulation/releases>

Many thanks @cylkee , works great, you don't by any chance know if there are
any versions of image cropper around that would work with this do you?

@RepublicOfDave I've not heard of an Image Cropper extension. I've found the
image cropping capabilities of the JIT extension to be adequate.
