@michael-e because I never got back yesterday - tried using the variable
`$etm-recipient` and works like a charm. Thanks much

@jonmifsud How do you differentiate the differents orders in the new order
field ?? Is the first one always the unfiltered one ?

I think in EDT 10:00-13:00 window should work fine. haven’t got anything
planned in terms of meeting in that timespan for the rest of the week

usually unfiltered order would the primary - then there are filters which can
be set for orders. but each order only works when you’re filtering.

thanks. if you have any question you want me to look at before just drop it
here and I’ll have a look maybe you uncovered a bug
