@animaux thanks for your comments. I found the issue. The geocode API doesn't
work if it has IP/URL restrictions on it. I plan therefore use one
unrestricted API key in the Symphony field preferences and another restricted
one to show maps on the site.

Hopefully Google will not wallop me with fees for over-usage!

Hi all,

I'm trying to send an email by getting a template from ETM via built in Email
class in Symphony ( Email::create() ). Following is my code.

`// Create an email instance  
$email = Email::create();

    
    
        // Load the order confirmation template from ETM
        $template = EmailTemplateManager::load('my-tmpl');
    
        // Set etm-entry-id
        $template->addParams(array(
            "etm-entry-id" => $id
        ));
    
        // Get DS values
        $xml = $template->processDatasources();
    
        // Generate xml tree and set values on template
        $template->setXML($xml->generate());
    
        // Parse the values
        $template->parseProperties();
    
        // Get parsed properties for debug
        //$properties = $template->getParsedProperties();
        // Render the template
        $content = $template->render();
    
        // Set all email properties
        if (!empty($content['subject'])) {
            $email->subject = $content['subject'];
        }
        if (!empty($content['recipients'])) {
            $email->recipients = $content['recipients'];
        }
        if (isset($content['reply-to-name'])) {
            $email->reply_to_name = $content['reply-to-name'];
        }
        if (isset($content['reply-to-email-address'])) {
            $email->reply_to_email_address = $content['reply-to-email-address'];
        }
        if (isset($content['plain'])) {
            $email->text_plain = $content['plain'];
        }
        if (isset($content['html'])) {
            $email->text_html = $content['html'];
        }
    
        // Send email
        $email->send();`

I'm getting this error once the code is executed =>

`Symphony Warning: stream_socket_enable_crypto(): SSL: Success

An error occurred in
/var/www/mysite/public_html/symphony/lib/toolkit/class.smtp.php around line
384`

The site is on SSL. Can someone please help me ?

What's in Symphony's main log?

Guys, sorry. It was a config issue. The problem is now solved.

Strange. It seems that this happens when Symphony attempts a connection to the
email server. Can you send password-forgotten emails (which use the config in
the Symphony prefs)? Have you added the configuration to your email template?

Solved? Ah OK!

@stuartgpalmer glad you found the issue!

I used osm geocoding a while ago. It worked quite good, with some issues
though.

@michael-e FYI the problem reported by @nimanthaharshana was that in the
config  
`‘secure’ => ’tls,`  
Should have been  
`‘secure’ => ‘no’,`
