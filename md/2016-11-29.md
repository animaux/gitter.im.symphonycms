If there’s anyone using `search_index`around. How can I trigger reindesxing of
an entry that’s changed via a frontend form? Apperently this is not happening
:’(

____

Hmm. Ok, it seems `search_index` is not at fault. I had a `reflection_field`
that was not updated.

@michael-e / @animaux what I do usually is send a blank post for that field -
but I guess that’s not always desired

if you update via frontend without sending the ‘reflection field’ in the
post/save request it’s not updated

In my case it seems to work for now. I got rid of the reflection field.

____

So if you send an empty field it will be populated?

you said

`99.999% there is a patch for this by @michael-e known occurance at times it
creates the field data twice not sure why. To fix you will have to manually
fix the db entry. Remind me tomorrow and I'll get you the link to the patch so
it does not reoccur`
