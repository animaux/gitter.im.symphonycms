Anyone know what could make this happen suddenly

    Accessing  static property Administration::$Database as non static

no-one 's been working on the site code so could be a hosting problem?

Sounds like a PHP update to me. Is it an older version of Symphony? (The
current codebase should work with newer PHP versions.)

@michael-e Yep, it's an old, old one. Downloading everything to local so I can
have a proper look.

Old Symphony versions will definitely have issues with newer PHP versions. PHP
has become stricter with warnings and errors.

The hosting company dropped PHP3 without notice, they still offer php2. I
moved the hosting :)
