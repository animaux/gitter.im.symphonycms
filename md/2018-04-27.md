Hi all. Can anyone suggest why filtering may not be working for this section.
Any idea what would trigger that error?

Well. Its massive section. There is a SBL linked to a reflection field in
another section. I am wondering if that could cause an issue, although I use
that elsewhere with no issue

Yes, its just this one section. Also, in the staging server it appears to be
working OK. That runs an earlier MySQL version - 5.5.59

I wonder is it possible with Symphony. I mean, I saw someone made bundle, but
it's very old by now. [unsure if it's even vue2]

Well, usign it should not be a problem since vue is a client framework

____

you just have to use Symphony frontend to generate json

@nitriques can you please delete
<http://symphonyextensions.com/extensions/epiceditor/> from the Sym Extensions
site? When I clicked on the link to _Epic Editor_ in the README I was
redirected to a malware site!
