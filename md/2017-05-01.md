as in ideally we don’t allow it in the first place. + the fix I’m not sure

the fix was made on a field basis, so each field can accommodate what it
needs.

____

See it keeps happening:

but the thing is: the DB can be changed externally (like via phpMyAdmin). it
's not supposed to, but it CAN happen

I fully understand  @michael-e point of view (which is valid) but I feel like
adding protection can't hurt

@nitriques what are you looking for in that extension? the update path looks
like it was used to add an index on the handle; not a unique on entry_id which
is I guess what we have to do next. I’d probably add a query to check if the
unique index exists first + alerting

____

@nitriques at some point might ask your opinion on some Slow Queries… maybe
you have some ideas how we can make certain joins/queries faster (but as it’s
getting late not going to look into it right now - just a heads up)
