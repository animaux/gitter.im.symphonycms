For me a killer feature would be sections on the same principle as
datasources. Thus as editable files and that you can exchange the section
files between different installs.

For my question about the smtp error it was idd due to a smtp block for web
users. So my initial cli check works for the root user but from the system for
web users not

Good to know. Although I don't understand the error message.

@moretaste Having sections as files would be hard, since it would need to sync
with the DB schema (just like you have to update your data source if you
change your fields)... I think we just need a import/export system rather
saving the schema to disk

yep agreed - using something like scaffolds if you don’t is great. The only
thing it requires to be 100% is that the datasources use names rather than
fields. (though that does add the need of an extra query)

It's a wish without thinking about the technology idd. But an export or import
feature for sections sounds great. Once there was the scaffold thing from
@brendo. But that was browser based if I remember it well.

So... what do you people think of PyroCMS? If I remember correctly, they do
have some sort of schema files for their sections which update database in
case something changes, although I didn't take a very detailed look at it yet.

@brendo Can you outline how you’d split the project into separate components?
I’ve been evaluating a lot of Node/JavaScript frameworks over the last two
years and the longer that journey took the clearer was the sentiment that
modularisation can get really painful.

____

Only insiders understand the whole picture, it gets hard for newcomers.

____

Also, if the components get „too“ reusable the core target might get lost:
building a system like Symphony

____

Things tend to fragment. You need to use Composer or npm and run a build
script to get anything usable.

Remember the times when you got real downloads on a project’s homepage? Today
you get a list of commands you have to understand to build what you need. This
is a regress from the user’s point of view in my eyes – at least for those
users that are not developers but simple users.

that, or a CLI tool to scaffold your project

____

which isn 't the most user-unfriendly thing, but definitely a departure from
the ol' zip file

A CLI can be quite user-friendly (thinking of the Ember CLI for example,
<https://ember-cli.com/>) – but it’s not newbie-friendly. And it’s not easy
for visually thinking people (e. g. designers).

____

When we started using Symphony it was one `index.php` that downloaded and
installed the system. _That_ was user-friendly. No need to find the right repo
and no need to care for dependencies.

@nilshoerrmann @reygoch "that modularisation can get really painful." ->
dependancy management is painfull. Splitting an app into a couple of modules
would help a lot !!! and that work will be done incrementally

____

and yeah, having the whole thing download itself would be nice. and it easy to
do when you have a cli ;)

with one zip you have to trust that it all works, with modules you have to
trust the build tool. But agree with @nilshoerrmann at times it seems all so
be complicated and the border between design and technology gets smaller and
smaller. The learning curve can be steep. Which isn't bad because our work is
the balance between design (and communication and marketing), technology and
end users.

I must admit that I feel like @nilshoerrmann. It's hard for me to believe in
the vision. We already suffer from fragmentation — nowadays, how shall
newcomers know what to install? (e.g: Which extensions? What is a workspace?
Is there a modern example workspace at all?)

____

I don 't say that your vision is wrong. But we probably must accept that a
"modularized" Symphony will attract more nerds and less designers.
