morning. I still have a problem with my event. Before `execute()` I need to
have the `$entry_id` of the first entry to set the association with the other
entries.. But in the 'pre validate' the entry id is null.

____

This is the code I have now:

____

    
    
     public function load(){
      if(isset($_POST['action'][$this->ROOTELEMENT]))
      {
      // COPY REQUIRED DATA TO COLLEGA FIELDS
        $this->required();
      // XML HOLDER TO RETURN VALIDATION
        $post_result = new XMLElement($this->ROOTELEMENT);
      // VALIDATE EACH ENTRY
        foreach ($_POST['fields'] as $position => $fields)
        {
          $result=$this->validate($position);
        // ADD VALUES AND MESSAGES BACK TO XML
          if (isset($result) && is_object($result)) {
            $post_result->appendChild($result);
          }
        // ADD THE RESULT IN AN ARRAY
          $arr_result[]=$result;
        }
        // CHECK THE RESULT
          if (in_array("error", $arr_result)) {
        // STOP
            return $post_result;
          } else {
        // GO
    
        // SEND EMAIL
        // insert custom email code HERE
    
        // EXECUTE RESULT

When an entry has been committed, there is an entry ID (`$entry->get('id')`).
But generally speaking, you are trying to achieve something rather complex
here, which won't work by trial and error. You would have to dive into
Symphony's logic and understand **what** happens **when**. How are events
executed? How and when are filters executed? … If you can 't take the time do
to understand that stuff, I think it's wise to return the project to the
client.

I know I shouldn’t be saying this **but** would client validation be
sufficient?

____

So if you validate in Javascript would that be a problem? Or there is
something more complex you need to validate. But as  @michael-e said you
should spend time to **understand** symphony if you want to get out of the
‘standard’ flow of things.

I've tried to dive into the logic with this project and learn more about the
system. But it is like learning walking as a baby: fall and stand up.

____

Front-end validation could be ok. But there is also the requirement of sending
an e-mail confirmation with all of the attendees listed.

____

For that I need the association.

Yes so remove the association from being required in backend- that should work
for validation purposes in the backend.

when doing the ‘dry validation run’ they will all validate

That is what I do. But with the execute() all entries are submitted and can't
achieve to submit position 0 only before the others (but that would be part of
missing the understanding of the logic of symphony.

In that case

____

simple solution would be, to stop the excute from running; break the items
individually. and run execute for the 1st item and then for the rest.

____

another option is to manually add the associations to the association table
once the data is generated. but you need to get dirty with the database and
the core api

This is really strange, because the `SendmailGateway` class extends the
`EmailGateway`class. The latter has a `setRecipients` method.

Honestly, I think you are messing up a lot of stuff. You shouldn't even need
to use the ETM programatically, a simple filter would do if your event wasn't
a mess. I can't help you by doing your work, all I can do is give you
pointers. If you want to stick to this project, take a piece of paper and draw
what you want to achieve **before coding**. Look at Symphony 's core and try
to understand how events and filters work. Solve your issue systematically.

The pro part was more cynical but even my sense of humor isnt't that great.

But the longer answer (because I was out of the door). The other time you were
surprised that the magic methods didn't work. With my lack of knowledge I
thought maybe there is a bug with the magics (due to a private function for
example) because the extended classes seems to be loaded but the values are
NULL. Thus my question was more that you know the classes and logic behind the
etm and emailgateway than hey here is my project and I need it before 5.00 pm.

The other part to work systematically. I do or at least I'll try. That's my
whole way of working: make small steps to make a giant step. So I 'draw out'
that I needed two sections and needed to validate all entries before submit so
I could make a calculation of the costs and deliver a payment link/redirect
with a summary of all attendees as confirmation. I search the forum how to
achieve that and find the tutorial of Brendo that seems to do exactly what I
needed. My thought was I would walk step by step through that tutorial and
learn more from events, php in general and will achieve the result I needed.

Things went wrong when the tutorial seems to be outdated (event was changed in
a class). So I rethinked my steps and thought then that I could accommplish
the result with reading classes and some trial and error. When that went wrong
I rethinked the whole thing and started over with a new plan of action.

Submit to one section and fill in the required fields for the other attendees
with the post data and send the e-mail to the first entry in the array. That
all works. Only I had problems with the email (as a filter it was executed for
all entries) and I missed the association between the entries. The latter I
assumed that the validate function created an entry and deleted that entry
when there was an error. So when all validated succesfull there should be a
complete entry with entry id. That assumption was wrong seems, so I think a
step back and would use a for each to execute entry 0 first etc.

My messing up stuff and dumb (however a question never can be dumb) questions
are part of my learning curve (walking we all have learn with falling and
standing up again). The only thing I asked for is those pointers so in the
future I can maybe answer the next dumb ass his questions.

But for now I will go debug the mail logic to figure it out myself why it
without the magic methods works and with not.

@animaux do you need to convert it to markdown?

Not neccesarily. I need to get rid of some nasty markup though. Converting to
markdown was one solution I’d thought of.

xmlimporter does not clean the HXML to XHTML though; which is where you’d need
an extra library…

Suddenly the import gives me `Symphony Warning: json_encode() expects
parameter 2 to be long, string given`

____

There’s no JSON involved though. Hmmm.

____

Hmn, guess this was my futile try to config the _HTMLPurifier_

Adding settings in the `formatter.markdown_with_purifier.php`doesn’t seem to
have any effect.

____

Oh, maybe it does! But it’s only visible the resulting DS output.

____

Very good!

@moretaste: Thanks for finding that. As you may know, I have not invented the
ETM, I just try to be the maintainer. :-) Obviously @creativedutchmen
implemented this "magic setter" function. So indeed the correct API is
`->recipients` or similar. Changing that would be a breaking change…

Well, looking at that code I am a bit puzzled now. You linked to the core
email gateway class, which is different from the ETM logic.

I just did what you said there. Call the etm template and after that call the
email class with the data of the etm template.

____

It works and make sense for me

And I know you the maintainer. No offense. Pretty sad we lost people like
@creativedutchmen, @nickdunn, @nilshoerrmann, @designermonkey, @brendo and
ofcourse @allen and @pointybeard and all those I forgot like @bauhouse.

Yep, it's a pity.

____

Regarding the APIs: We have to distiguish the Core Email API from the ETM 's
API. The core API is documented [in the Symphony
Wiki](https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/wiki/Email-in-Symphony), but
the ETM's API has no documentation.

____

When I find the time, I will build a test scenario and validate the core email
API docs as well as create a documentation for the ETM. This may also lead to
some pull requests/commits to have everything as streamlined as possible…
