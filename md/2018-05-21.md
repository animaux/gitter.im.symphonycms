@nitriques yes, we could add a setting to specify the delimiter in
Import/Export CSV, my only question here is whether we need it?

Is a semicolon option even needed given that the worldwide standard is a
comma? If people need a semicolon option then we'll add it into the
preferences, if not, I suggest a straight switch. Any thoughts guys?

It might depend on the language, but if I export to CSV in Excel, semicolons
are used.

This makes me think that commas in CSV may not be "world standard".

Thanks Michael. Yes, it appears that is a [location specific
thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values#Basic_rules) since
commas are used as decimal places in the EU.

So it seems like an option in preferences would be worth implementing
