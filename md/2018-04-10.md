Hi all,

Is there any possibility we could change the HTML structure of a backend
section entry field such as a textarea? By default the textarea wraps inside a
label as follows,

`<label><textarea></textarea></label>`

I want it to be,

`<label></label><textarea></textarea>`

or in a different way.

Can someone please help me ? :-)

or can I change it to a `<div>` instead of a `<textarea>` (Removing the
wrapping label)?

I'm trying to create a new Richtext editor extension, so editor doesn't appear
properly when the textarea wraps around a label

@diomed The client requested Fraola in this case. Perhaps if the extension
looks good, people in the Sym community could club together for a licence so
that we can release it.

Is this the place to try `3.0.x` currently?
<https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/tree/3.0.x> or is the most current
stuff in another fork somewhere? @nitriques

@nimanthaharshana jQuery could do that easily, see
[.wrap()](https://api.jquery.com/wrap/) and
[.unwrap()](https://api.jquery.com/unwrap/). It just depends whether you can
perform the DOM writing action before the Rich Text editor does its stuff.
Also beware that the backend CSS relies on it being `<label>` so you would
need to apply new CSS rules.

`\o/` Yeah! Still eager to try `:)` Is there any basic info on how to make use
of the PDO-Stuff in Custom-DSs already?
