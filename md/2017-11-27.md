Has anyone been using distance based filtering with `maplocationfield`lately?

Ah, apparently it has some `PHP 7.1`-issues regarding numeric values.

@animaux haven’t used it with PHP 7.1 been a while ago hope you figure it out

____

separate question… anyone wondered around AMP with Symphony got wondering on
how to get some valid output… looking at their minimum requirements validator:
<https://validator.ampproject.org/>

@jonmifsud thanks. Seems I only had to use `M_PI`instead of `pi`.

@VadimMilevskiy seems you’re on the wrong forum - that looks like the Symfony
Framework. It’s spelled differently

Hi all, Is there any way of deleting a section entry from the front end ?

@nimanthaharshana I try to avoid to have that kind of power on the frontend
and use a `published` checkbox or alike instead.

@nimanthaharshana we use delete entry in our frontend cms (only for a highest
level role) and as an alternative we use a checkbox field active and filter
the datasource then with active =Yes

in all honesty had a team member do that for a client months ago

____

started when AMP was out but client priorities…

____

pushed it back so I just revised it today (4hrs) and should be ready to go -
but will keep this handy

____

though I think we needed to anyway the site is way too complex for a
converter...
