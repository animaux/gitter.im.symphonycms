Hi, I am new to using Symphony. I installed on my local computer, them I tried
to login but getting this message "Request was rejected for having an invalid
cross-site request forgery token". Can someone help me please.

Please go back and try again.

If you add `indent="no"` to the output declaration, the html will be minified
when rendered

What are people 's methods for image optimisation within Symphony? For clients
that don't get how to change file size or resolution, what are your solutions?
There is an Image Cropper extension, but it's not maintained anymore by the
looks of it.

I find Image JIT unpredictable too. Sometimes the image outputs is larger than
the original (which really confused me), and the extensions throws errors for
me a lot.

@ODDCODE try changing the `enable_xsrf` line in the `config.php` file (line
24) to `no`
