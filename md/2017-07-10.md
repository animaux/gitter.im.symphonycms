@pixelninja The bundled [JIT Image
Manipulation](https://github.com/symphonycms/jit_image_manipulation) works a
treat for me. You can set the default 'quality' in config.php under `######
IMAGE ######` with `'quality' => '90'` or with individual recipes in the
Preferences UI, where you can also set 'Disable upscaling of images beyond the
original size'. Latest stable version is 1.46.

@pixelninja Sometimes emptying `manifest/cache` helps, or making sure it's
writeable in the first place.

Hi all. I installed a fresh Symphony instance on my Ubuntu 16 server and
checked out the 2.7.x branch. I get the following error when trying to
upgrade:

@stuartgpalmer your primary key to author already exists, and i think that
this can't be duplicated

Thanks @josealbertorodriguesjunior. Presumably that would always already exist
for Symphony upgrades? Anyway, I noticed that the database was already as it
needs to be from the [upgrade
file](https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/blob/2.7.x/install/migrations/2.7.0.php)
and so deleted [those
lines](https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/blob/2.7.x/install/migrations/2.7.0.php#L30-L52)
before upgrading. I'm not sure if this might be a bug in the upgrade file
though?
