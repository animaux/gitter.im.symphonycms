Hey. :) I've got a client who's asked for their site to be updated from `2.3`
to `2.7.0.beta2` (they're switching the server over to PHP7), however I'm
guessing the installer is not yet complete, as it can't find the
`migration_270` class when I copy `install/` over from either of the `2.7.x`
or `2.7.x-installer` branches. Is this the case, or have I missed a step? The
class exists in `install/migrations/2.7.0.php`, so I'm guessing there's a
missing reference somewhere?

What's up with the version ordering at
<https://github.com/symphonycms/jit_image_manipulation/releases> ? My `git
submodule add git://github.com/symphonycms/jit_image_manipulation.git
extensions/jit_image_manipulation --recursive` retrieved version `2.0.0` \- is
that correct?

@TwoWholeWorms I have not bothered about that before but have updated several
sites to `2.7.0.beta2` happily.

____

@cylkee Yeah, `2.0.0` is not ready yet but fortunately the latest `1.x`
version runs fine even on Symphony `2.7.0.beta2` and `PHP 7`.

I do, but I'm still getting `Symphony Warning: call_user_func() expects
parameter 1 to be a valid callback, class 'migration_270' not found`.

The code in `Symphony::getMigrationVersion()` implies that there's some kind
of autoloader which is supposed to handle the loading of `migration_270` from
`2.7.0.php`, as there's no require or include in that method which I can
see—just the `scandir()` and `call_user_func()` calls.

@TwoWholeWorms make sure you have the latest version of the index.php file and
the vendor folder

____

the autoloader is in there

Why does `git submodule update --init --recursive` often not do what I think
it's meant to do: pull the latest extension versions? I know of at least two
of my 12 extensions are out of date. Yet, the above command first reported
`Submodule path 'extensions/multiuploadfield': checked out
'98a9aa1f0e6df93b03eeeae868f3e4a3d052de5d'`. Any other attempts creates no
response. I can go into each extension folder and do `git pull origin
master`but that's long.
