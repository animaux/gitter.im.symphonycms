A friend of mine is building a Symphony website, and he needs a solution for
Twitter tweets. Do you have any idea if it's possible to add oAuth to the
Remote Datasource extension? Or any other idea?

I would be able to share some peices of code I've made on that regard ;)

____

And yes, I 've already created all the things needed to support oAuth in
Remote Datasources

____

Just to be sure, we are only talking about READING the twitter feed with the
Remote Datasource, right ?

Oh! That would be cool! You wouldn't need to release anything (and get all the
support loadâ€¦). If you could pass me some code and some pointers, that would
be great! Yes, READing only, of course.

copy a valid bearer token to auth your app

It looks perfectly manageable! It's for a friend of mine, who builds his first
Symphony website (but has some experience with PHP etc.). It sounds like we
will have a new Symphony fan.
