A friend of mine is building a Symphony website, and he needs a solution for
Twitter tweets. Do you have any idea if it's possible to add oAuth to the
Remote Datasource extension? Or any other idea?

I would be able to share some peices of code I've made on that regard ;)

__ __

And yes, I've already created all the things needed to support oAuth in Remote
Datasources

__ __

Just to be sure, we are only talking about READING the twitter feed with the
Remote Datasource, right ?

Oh! That would be cool! You wouldn't need to release anything (and get all the
support load…). If you could pass me some code and some pointers, that would
be great! Yes, READing only, of course.

just fill out 1. the account name (or change the url for your needs) and then
copy a valid bearer token to auth your app

__ __

yup that's it !

__ __

you need php_curl tho .

Yes, it's nice indeed. I will try and enjoy it much more when my projects calm
down a bit.

It looks perfectly manageable! It's for a friend of mine, who builds his first
Symphony website (but has some experience with PHP etc.). It sounds like we
will have a new Symphony fan.
