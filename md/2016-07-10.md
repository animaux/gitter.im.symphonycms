Good morning all, been doing some early morning sym performance checks, and
I’ve been wondering if it’s possibe to `evaluate` a filter through
`__processParametersInString` or in any way make it feasible via a delegate.

Use case: I have a lot of conditional statements in my datasources depending
on parameters matching a particular value or set of values. But given that I
have a lot of possible values it’s significantly increasing the number of
combinations which directly impacts any datasource caching (reducing potential
benefits)

Idea is something like `{$param} = x` or potentially `{$param} in (x,y,z)`
which would return a boolean (yes/no)

Maybe we could add a delegate for this

I can `extend` this on a per-datasource level at this point

but not sure that’s a great way of potentially adding other options; not sure
sending a bunch of pull requests with possible added functionality might be
ideal - though I can do that to raise the question.
