____

no what I would mean with UI polish is that I have extensions which take
config options (but are manually set by me in the config) and without those a
good % of the community wouldn’t be able to use them if it’s not in the web
config options

@nitriques, @michael-e, when there's something to test let me know and I'll
try it with Hiawatha + FastCGI (PHP-FPM). I'm sure it will be fine - $SERVER
is available there unless I'm mistaken.

it’s for 3.x I believe you should use a 2.7.x branch as integration of the
next version (if not mistaken) because we’re using versioning

> @animaux, @jonmifsud: That EXSLT calendar is missing additional logic for
leap years, see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year#Algorithm>

@michael-e Actually there is some logic regarding leap-years already avalable
in exslt: <http://exslt.org/date/index.html>

Yes, I know, i have worked with EXSLT's date functions sometimes. They can be
pretty useful, e.g. if you need to add a duration to a date. That is
impossible in plain XSLT.

But, compared to PHP's full-blown toolset, there are limitations. You can not,
for example, work with "local" dates (e.g. which date is "Germany, daylight
saving time"?).

much "business logic". :-)

It's a matter of the mindset, probably. Also to me XSLT is more like "fun",
PHP is more like "work". But it's completely the other way 'round for many
people.
