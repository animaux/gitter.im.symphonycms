`selectize.js` does begin to feel like a bit of hack.

@nitriques @jonmifsud ok, in order to make `selectize.js` work for single-
select-remove-buttons in the AI selector, I need a hack in one of it’s
plugins. Since it really looks like it’s not used anywhere else by symphony
anymore – should we remove it from the core then?

I have included my own hacked version of `selectize.js` in the
`association_ui_selector` which seems to override the included version in
`symphony.min.js` fine.

@animaux that would work but if we go that way we’d have to remove
`selectize.js` from the core eventually to avoid issues.

Eventually it might be good to get rid of selectize.js in the selector as
well. Looks like the code is not very actively maintained anymore.

But that’s not a job I’d be able to do.

Well, it feels like there’s some hacking to accommodate it for the AI selector
and to override styles, etc.

__ __

The remove_button behaviour was also very strange.

__ __

It’s more a feeling than anything I can put my finger on. Especially since I’m
not a programmer.

Also it says: **Selectize needs your help. I'm looking for maintainers!**

I guess at some point we’d have to decide of mantaining something; creating
afresh (also mantaining) or use another library. (first vs 2nd option; I’d
take the first if it works)

Hang on. I think I’m actually not directly importing associations via XML-
impoter.

I have an XML-Import that runs through an extra-page that outputs xml and
compares person names against a handle from a reflection-field in order to
retreive the @id.
