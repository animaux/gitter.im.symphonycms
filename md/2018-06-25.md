@michael-e I have a problem with ETM, recipients are suddenly empty â€¦ it
worked before. Not sure what change caused this to break. Could `$etm-entry-
id` for some reason not be available for filtering the adress-source-DS?

OK. I found the problem. If any xpath expression in the Recipients-Field
yields no results, the whole whing breaks. So apparently only required fields
can be used here. I was expecting unset optional parts to simply stay empty.

Are there any examples of custom-DS SQL-queries lurking around?
