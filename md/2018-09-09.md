I think you’re missing a MySQL auto-update field on modification date; as
otherwise it would be defined here.

hmm and you did not have tried to update to a newer version of symphony at any
point have you?

____

that field you mention was added in 2.3.1 there’s an off chance that you have
the database of 2.3.1 but not the right code

not that I’m aware of. Mongo is a NoSQL structure which changes completely the
logic which Symphony uses. Symphony is built on relational databases NoSQL
works in a completely different way; meaning in most cases you cannot query
data in the same way you do with SQL (not unless you have some middleware or a
graph engine)
