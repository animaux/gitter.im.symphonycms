Hi all,  
can someone please tell me what is the delegate which I can hookup with, when
a new entry is added in the backend (Only on new entries, not when updating a
record) ? I found a delegate => `XMLImporterEntryPostEdit` which works in both
occurences, but I need to run some code when a new entry is added to a section
in the backend.

We have a frontend upload that accepts any kind of files (jpg,mp4,pdf)

____

in a custom event we check the type, and then choose the field accordingly

____

this works, but when a member uploads a jpg

____

and wants to change it to mp4 (=edit), we can 't empty the image field

____

(we use image field, because of the resizing and file upload)

____

anybody got a clue? :)
