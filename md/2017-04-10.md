> bulk uploading images

Not quite but could be done fairly easily

> inserting them into content?

I usually use some markdown adjusted UI with an association Field which does
the trick really nicely for embedding content into a textarea in conjunction
with the HTML ninja technique

That’d be great. It basically runs, but has some quirks and could use some
love.

Hi guys, don't judge me but I'm only come to the git party now so I'm still
learning :(. I've been cloning the symphony repository and any needed
extensions for a while now and it has all been working perfect (cloning
directly to the website server). However, I haven't been using git on my
utilities and pages :worried: . Can you give a two or three line summary of
how to use git with the Symphony repositories on my work computer and then
pushing to the web server? thanks. Sorry for being a NOOB.

ah 2 options

____

  1. Use workspace as a submodule (maybe cleaner but more hassle)
  2. remove workspace from .gitignore and commit all that’s inside of it.

____

as regards server you can either have automatic scripts which pull/submodule
sync/update via hooks or just run those manually on the servers

the in-between would be a private github/bitbucket repo(s) to hold your
private data

I was looking at Amazon CodeCommit as it give 50Gb free, has anyone had any
experience with it? Or is it better to stay in github world?

This might be a silly question, continuing on the version control, how do you
keep the data in the mysql database in sync or do you connect directly from
your working machine to the db and only version the code?

mainly only version the code

____

but in some instances it might make sense to look into the CDI extension

____

it helps you push up changes in Pages/Sections etc

____

not entries though

Do we have some kind of "repeater" field with which I can enter multiple,
lets's say, telephone numbers?

@reygoch Hmm, a `tag field` might be able to do what you want. Another one
could be [meta
keys](http://symphonyextensions.com/extensions/field_metakeys/), in case you
want things like: Fax: 123, Mobile: 456, etc.

@reygoch \- <https://github.com/brockpetrie/dynamictextgroup> also might
server you well for this kind of job. Though it probably might need some
update love (but as far as I remember I've got it running on a 2.6.7 page
without trouble).
