@jonmifsud I would create two separate url for this

____

/ is version A, /alternate/ (or whatever, could also be done with a query
string)

____

that way, caches will still work

____

on top of the  <head> section, do some javascript to detect if the user needs
to be redirected to /alternate/ or not

____

inline javascript redirects in the head (before css) are quite fast (I used
one <http://shop.boutiquerollin.com/>, you'll see it's fast)

____

As far as the per-user/session/pageview basis, it could be also be done that
way. But I prefer doing A/B for:

____

  1. Only new, not loggued users

____

  1. create a cookie so they always end up having the same version (to remove any confusion on their part)

____

  1. Try to keep track of stats... aim at 50% 50% distribution.. this can be done via a simple ajax call (or Google Analytics even)

@nitriques thanks much seems to make sense with the redirect (didn’t think of
applying it that way)

@jonmifsud it's a "hack" but works really well in that case

In my case we don’t have logged in users. so A/B will be generic with a local
storage / cookie to see if they are to stay redirecting.

____

yeah. I was between that and modifying content in the Dom via JS

____

or css

____

but would depend on the changes required for the test

I would really prefer to have two separate urls in that case ... but yeah,
could be done with js/css also

____

that way it 's easier to create segments and compare user behavior in Google
Analytics

____

based on the homepage the user saw

I'll send a PR as soon as I can

____

right now, the client site is ok running the patch: so far, so good. ;)

____

but I really fear that I 've broken some filtering stuff... :S
