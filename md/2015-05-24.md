@jonmifsud Did a litle more work on it today. Decided on the XPath being
written as relative to the subset, but it’ll append the DS’s XPath to avoid
any potential mess

@brendo I’m not sure if you remember your URL to PDF extension. It had
something to do with attachments for ETF - would some similar logic work with
ETM? or complete no-go?

  1. creating PDFs

____

  1. attaching them to emails

@michael-e yep - I’ve had decent success doing 1 with modifications to ETM -
generated plenty of pages with PDF client reports in the past.

____

I know it’s possible to add attachments with Symphony email api (done that in
the past) but never merged the two together. Always had emails with
attachments sent separate from ETM

Attaching PDFs using ETM is pretty simple, indeed I hacked it to do this. :-)
Creating emails is another issue, I personally use Apache FOP to do it (via
XSL-FO).

____

Do you need to attach a single attachment? Or multiple?

Single for now - nothing urgent just a small pet project.

____

But I don’t want to create a ‘public’ symphony page to generate the PDFs. as
that would have been fairly easy to achieve. just not sure how to best boot up
pdf generation at that stage.

I’ve used mpdf for pdf generation in the past. with XSLT templates - seems to
work pretty well (performance is slow with long multi pagers) but shouldn’t be
an issue for this

yep exactly.

____

what  @brendo had was some detection of html data attribute inside the email
template - extracted that and generated the pdf (eventually attaching it)
which seems ‘ok’ I guess not sure if that approach makes sense with ETM.

OK, got it.

  * I have a folder in the workspace that is protected using `.htaccess` ("deny all").
  * The PDFs are created using URLs, and the URL is called by an avent filter (using `file_get_contents`), then the result is saved in the mentioned folder using `file_put_contents`
  * (The URLs have an access token.)
  * When emails are sent, the PDF is attached as a file using the path on the server.

The physical URL of the file on the server is not visible to the public, nor
can it be accessed directly. But yes, I am creating the PDFs using a page, and
if you guess the page URL, the page is triggered. In the XSLT template,
however, I test for the access token and don't generate any useful result if
the token is incorrect.

____

So I have two different things: A public URL to create PDFs, and a
protected/private URL for the physical files.

If the "public" URL is just creating and writing the PDFs, but not exposing
them, your only risk is a "DOS attack". You always have this risk, with every
page.

regards the physical file - would it make more sense to place that within
manifest/tmp? unless you need to keep them for historical records.

Yes, in the case I described I need them, because they are order
confirmations. But, oh yes, I have other PDF files in manifest/tmp.

I send a second email to myself with the PDF attached, but I like to have them
all on the server, in a dedicated directory.

____

In my version of ETM I can attach files using parameters, e.g.:

    
    
     /workspace/media/some/path/W1B{/data/some-ds/entry/@id}.pdf

duplication doesn’t hurt. My use case shouldn’t be so sensitive. Just trying
to get a local organisation to take proxies online (they never reach quota).

I should talk to @creativedutchmen if we should merge this into the main repo.
It's indeed useful. I even can change the "From name" and the "From email",
but of course your mileage with that may vary, depending on your email server.

I usually send stuff using the Mandrill SMTP API, which is pretty flexible.

____

Thanks :) I think I should be fine just wanted to check what’s the best-
practice stuff. So If there was an ‘easy’ way to get done I’d follow that. I’m
getting wary of taking on too many different things as I have al bunch of
unreleased extensions / modifications already

@brendo yep 'grouping' sounds right but I didn't think of the right word. My
page is working but I repeated a code block that I'm not comfortable with. I
think I should either use modulus or something XSLT that I don't already know.
I can look up grouping now though. I did look at the template 'pagination.xsl'
but it was a bit too voodoo.

@munki-boy you just want groups of four right?

____

what if you did two nested loops? One using `position() mod 4 == 1` (ie first
of every four) and within that make a loop on the main items matching the
current position and next three items.

@jonmifsud it was going wrong in both ways because I put the condition into
the for-each rather than as an if-statement inside the for-each. So the node
count or position() was always being from 1 - 4 rather than the position()
from the full node-set. It was the same problem in my original question but I
refactored to your idea because it's neater.
