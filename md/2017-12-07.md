Is there a way to retrieve the `@id` of an entry just created by a frontend
form in order to use `<input name="redirect" type="hidden" value="{$root}/page
/{@newly-created-entry-id}" />` to show the result or do something with it?

____

I understand the redirect is called after the page is reloaded, so the `@id`
should be in the post-values? Is that correct?

Ah! `<event-handle result="success" type="created" id="319">`

But apparently the page is not reloaded and therefore the new ID not
accessable. I wonder how to get it from there?

@animaux We use custom events for this, would be good if this is possible
without customizing

One could use a xsl-conditional meta-refresh as well. Dirty but should work.
