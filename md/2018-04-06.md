Is there an easy way to associate/link a specific entry to a set of entries
(in another section) when multiple entries can be linked and some might
already have other linked entries? Let’s say I have a series of products that
all should link the same PDF-entry.

____

If only one associated PDF was allowed it would be easy to do in the index
view.

____

But is there a way to do this when multiple associations are allowed? I guess
in the DB …

Would be nice if this was doable via URL params in the backend, something like
`?entry-ids=12,456,245,56&associate-with-entry-ids=567`
