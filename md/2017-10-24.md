Hi all. I have a section which is filterable in Symphony 2.6.11. The filtering
seems to be broken. I get an error message as below:

"An error occurred while retrieving filtered entries. Showing all entries
instead."

Does anyone know how I could go about diagnosing this please?

@nitriques the issue seems to arise when sorting on a SBL field. Yes, its
running on MySQL 5.7.2
