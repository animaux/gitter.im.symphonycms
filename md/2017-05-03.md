@Creepjack I think you want to use the `multiple` setting for section 2. That
seems to be `saved` by the core of Symphony not manually.

@Creepjack I think `$_POST['fields']['field-name'][0]` is wrong. That must be
`$_POST['fields'][0]['field-name']`. Also don't forget in your form to add the
square brackets in your form `<input name="fields[{$index}][voornaam]"
type="text" ...`

@michael-e when using `ETM` and `Members` extensions – is the `$member-id` not
available in the e-mail-template?

____

Since it’s not visible in the e-mail-template `?debug`-mode.

No. If you use the ETM filter, you have the `$etm-entry-id` (which is the ID
of the saved entry). Additionally, POST values will be added to the params. Be
careful with the latter, this might have securitiy implications.

Depends on what you do. If you save a Member to the Members section, for
example, you can use the `$etm-entry-id` to filter a Members data source. If
you save something else, things will get more complicated.

____

The Default Event Values extension can be pretty handy then. :-) You might use
it to save the Member ID without the need to include it in the form as a
hidden field (which would be prone to DOM hacking!).

I was hoping I’d be able to create a DS that filters the created `order` by
`$etm-entry-id` and attach that to the template in order to filter a
`customer` section by the order’s `customer-id`.

____

However, are DS-Params even attached to the e-mail-template »page«?

Yep, they work. I have done some pretty complicated chaining. Let me explain…

____

For example, your section is called  "orders". Orders can only be done by a
Member. Add an SBL field to the orders section which saves the Member. (Use
Default Event Values to do actually add the ID on saving, see above).

In addition to what @michael-e said I’d recommend something like mailtrap.io
you send emails via SMTP to a catch-all. I believe they have some basic free
mailbox. You can actually send with any to/from emails and analyse stuff
there. Once I sort out the email templates that’s how I sort out issues with

Use a default template. (Create a new email template and then copy the
corresponding XSLT template.)

____

Re: missing `$etm-entry-id`— are you sure that you use the ETM's via the event
filter functionality? In this case, upon successful save, the filter will be
triggered, and the entry ID should be available for ETM. Remember to debug
using mails to a static recipient. You can output `<xsl:value-of select="$etm-
entry-id"/>` to this email.
