Plus since recently: »Is this Symphony Communication Services?«

Jokes aside, I wonder if it’s prudent to put too much content on third party
services. Gitter itself, even though it’s a very handy way to communicate, is
making it very hard for people to find information in discussions that was
very accessible in the forum before.

On completion of the donation we then redirect the user :)

We should have our own gitter-clone on getsymphony.com with a searchable
archive

Then in the end the forum did all that was neccessary. Hmm.

yeah I’d use it if I could “quick” answer and get “quick notifications” I
haven’t logged in for quite a while…
