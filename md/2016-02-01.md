@michael-e The fact that the sort operation is a global state is a problem: it
should always be possible to override it when calling fetch functionds

this is nice  @siimsoni :)

@nitriques: That's what I do in my code snippet, manually override it. Or do
you mean to have some override param in the function signature? a.k.a.
"footprint" :-)

Yep, good idea. One should probably add an unset method as well. At the moment
there is a "set" method, but no "unset".

Then one could evaluate the param and call the `unset` function if it
evaluates to `true`

OK, I took a look at the EntryManager class, and things are a little bit
confusing here.

____

`fetch` has a param called `$enable_sort` — you can switch off sorting here.
(What will MySQL do then?)

____

`fetchByPage` has no such param.

Answering my question: Switching off sorting, thus omitting the `ORDER BY`
clause is probably no good idea, see <http://dba.stackexchange.com/a/6053>

____

My suggestion is:

____

  * Implement a method called `unsetFetchSorting` (as counterpart to the existing `setFetchSorting`)

____

  * Add a parameter `$unset_fetch_sorting` to both methods (`fetch` and `fetchByPage`) — defaults to `false`

____

  * `fetchByPage` can simply pass this param to `fetch`

  * `fetch` can call `unsetFetchSorting()` if the parameter is `true`.

yes enable sort makes the EntryManager use the  "global" sort order

Can setFetchSorting receive null instead ?

I would add a enable_sort instead to stay 'sane'

`fetch`already has `$unset_fetch_sorting`, see above… it omits the `ORDER
BY`altogether, which is a bad idea.

____

Sorry, I meant it has `$enable_sort`.

That's what we should add to "by page" then

Yes, but if `$enable_sort` is false for `fetch`, sorting is disabled
completely. That's not useful at all. If we change this behaviour, we break
the API (unless we consider it a bugfix).
