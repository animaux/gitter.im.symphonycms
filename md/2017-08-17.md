@pixelninja one recommendation if youâ€™re doing this is not to repeat mistakes
of [Filemanager](https://github.com/iwyg/filemanager) as it tries to load all
the files via ajax and if you have too many files it just cloggs your publish
page until all renders.

____

but you could probably take inspiration from it

@pixelninja you can poke with /symphony/ajax/query/ (or check all the
content.ajax*.php files)

____

or you can create your own json page like so:
<https://github.com/DeuxHuitHuit/entry_relationship_field/blob/master/content/content.sectionsinfos.php>

____

or like this one:
<https://github.com/DeuxHuitHuit/entry_relationship_field/blob/dev/content/content.search.php>

____

but in the near future, I would like to have all the api pokeable via ajax
