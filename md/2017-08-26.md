Does this <https://github.com/symphonists/elasticsearch> still works?

Officially it's compatible with Symphony 2.3 only, and at the time it was
written Elasticsearch 0.18.7 was the latest version. If at all, it might work
with Elasticsearch 1.x, but this version is no longer supported.
(Elasticsearch 2.4.x is still supported, the current version is 5.5.x, see
<https://www.elastic.co/support/eol>). So I wouldn't use this extension unless
you are really willing to fix things yourself. Even then there might be risks
caused by dependencies (e.g. the Elastica PHP library).
