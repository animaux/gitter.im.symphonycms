ie a shortcode in symphony _should_ only be replaced by data available in the
XML

____

if you read up on the XSLT ninja technique it should help you get there

____

e.g. I use  <image id=‘123’/> to replace with the custom image markup which I
need

the shortcode you want to trigger it when serving content to the end user

which allows you to easily replace nodes with whatever you want - however this
works when serving html content (eg using a markdown formatter) as the ninja
technique matches XML nodes

to listen to

The popup can in theory ( if its a popup ) be included anywhere in the page.
So you do not need to add a shortcode…

____

*if you need a shortcode because it’s location specific. I would use  <insertPopup/> in the HTML Content - but you will need it every time 

____

then replace that with ninja technique.

yeah more or less. If you have coordinates (addresses) look into Address Field
Location

____

it will simplify from an extension point of view but the basics you need for
XSLT are all there with value-of / copy-of and ninja technique + sometimes you
might need some knowledge of recursion

yeah if you have a loop (eg articles) for each would work

____

or else if you want to re-use that snippet I would suggest

____

<xsl:apply-templates/> and a separate <xsl:template> block

but a for-each is a good place to start for most

it depends

____

more likely it’s a field

____

for Tags, there is a tag field. It should give you suggestions of previously
used items

____

Name not sure what you want, there is a select option, or you might want to
use an Association Field (if you need to edit the names separately outside of
that field) but to me it looks like a Tag Field or a Selectbox would be
appropriate

____

anyway I gotta run as I’ve something starting shortly

your best bet in that case would be a TagList

then there’s an extension which I built… which gives the taglist an
association interface… with dropdown

this uses the same ui but if you start with a taglist you’d be just fine
