@brendo: drop me a line if you come to Bavaria, or Austria, or northern Italy.
I want to travel a bit anyway, need holidays.

Does anyone know which part of a form submission event makes the input field
data stay populated when an error caused the entry not to save?

The XML would still contain the Post data, you could use that to re-populate
the fields.

Thanks @jonmifsud it wasn't in the XML when I looked so I found I needed to
add this to my custom event error

____

    
    
     $post_values = new XMLElement('post-values');
    // Create the post data element
    if (!empty($fields)) {
    General::array_to_xml($post_values, $fields, true);
    }
    if (isset($post_values) && is_object($post_values)) {
        $result->appendChild($post_values);
    }

we were all there once :) actually I don’t use that as much, since I use ajax
99% of the time, so values are still populated

Would that mean you're doing the custom stuff outside of the actual event
code?

no not really, what it would mean is that the request is sent using
javascript. So the client is not taken away from his current page. Then I just
send back a success/error message.

Ah, that's kind-of what I meant, I could have done what I needed with JS but
thought I'd make the effort to do it with events. It was just a field that
required only-if some checkbox is ticked.

ah yeah those checks I would still have in the event though.

____

just in case something goes wrong with javascript validation, or someone tries
to mess with the data.

Makes sense, JS was my fallback plan. This data is rather arbitrary so didn't
have to worry about security but glad I got it working the proper way.
