@josealbertorodriguesjunior likely you have a permission to save the entry. If
you are using member roles this is a common error if you add a new event but
fail to adjust permissions.

@josealbertorodriguesjunior if you search the error in your symphony project
files you will see that it comes from the member extension

The error means that the current Member role (this may also be the "public"
role, which means "no Member") has no event permission. (You probably need to
allow "new" entries for this role.)
