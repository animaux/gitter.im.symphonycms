Please could anyone tell me what happens when a person clicks Yes or No on a
cookie consent mini form?

it depends on your implementation.

If the person doesn’t accept cookies you’re not allowed to use them. The two
options are to allow browsing and remove any tracking such as GA etc. or else
tell the user they cannot use the site without cookies and send him back
somewhere else. (first one preferred if you care about your users) - or else
if you want to have cookies but not kickthem out put a one way notice that
they agree with cookies and only give ‘ok’ as an option. not sure if that
covers you legally

@jonmifsud if a person clicks Yes, I'll need to stop showing the little form
(by using a cookie) but would I ever need to prove later that they clicked it?
I mean do you have to keep everyone's IP address?

I don’t think that you’re required to keep IP’s keep in mind that most ISP’s
still work with Dynamic IP’s as long as you have the option, and you do not
track if you give a no option I think you’re fine

Cool, that's easier then. So I'll still need to store the person's answer to
the question and hide the form afterwards. Is there a 'current' solution and
do I need to look at a 'session' or 'cookie'?

depends on your implementation but sessions/cookies could both work. If you’re
doing the form with javsacript a cookie would be simpler. you could also use
something like local storage instead of cookies

That’s an interesting conundrum isn’t it

____

How do you store and uniquely identify that the user said no to cookies,
without violating their privacy

____

When it’s likely that’s why the said ‘no’ in the first place :P
