still valid?

____

mainly the  "I only want 'y' to execute if 'x' was successful!" part

Hello. Been looking for paypal / php channels, in vain. I am stuck with an
issue with Paypal PHP SDK : PayPalConnectionException : Response Code 401. Can
anyone help ?

Vain? I guess you work with the Symfony framework? In this case you've lost
your way — this is the Symphony CMS room, which has nothing to do with
Symfony.

Would it be possible to have a `unique_reflection_field`? For example to
prevent creation of an entry with an identical set of 3 specific
fields/values.

I wonder if it’s as easy as a frankenstein-job with the two field extensions.

Yes. Like a combination of a year, a month and a customer-id that must be
unique to prevent duplicate monthly orders.

if those entries are created via the frontend, I would create a custom event
filter to prevent that

yeah I concur

____

an extension to make the unique combo would be nice (no need for a field)
