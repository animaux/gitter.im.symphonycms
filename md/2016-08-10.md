@reygoch It does work, though it might have some quirks regarding synomymns.

There are some forks …

@reygoch I would recommend algolia for search ... easier then running your own
server

Hi guys,  
I installed Symphony using the following commands:

git clone
git://[github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2.git](http://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2.git)
target-directory

____

git checkout --track origin/bundle  
git submodule update --init --recursive

But the JIT extension is 1.16, I see in Github the latest is 2.0.0  
How do I get it to update?  
Thanks.

Shouldn't you have an option under "extensions" to update certain component
automatically?
