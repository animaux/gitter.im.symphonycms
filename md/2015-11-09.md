Does JIT understand params from an external website, for example
/media.objectmedia/37182006.jpg?resize=4 ?

nah it doesn't

____

And default values for DS filters already exists :)

____

$param:default

____

If $param isn’t set, “default” will be used

for filters like `'758' => 'equal to or greater than {$url-k}'`

Yeah I don’t think that exists actually

____

You can do  'equal to or greater than {$url-k:now}'

____

so if ?k= isn’t passed, it’ll use now

____

Not sure if that helps?

Nope those aren't dates but just numbers and when a field is empty it returns
nothing

____

I unset the filter now in the datasource

            if ($this->_env['param']['url-k'] == 0) {
                unset($this->dsParamFILTERS['758']);

from a form, a selectbox. It always send a default value from 0

So this is all in the backend context right?

____

An optional Select Box, and if an Author doesn’t select a value you’d like it
to be set to something so you can filter on it later?

Ah no, sorry for my haziness

____

I have a section with for example a plotsize, but not all entries have a
plotsize. In the front-end there is a selectbox to filter the entries on
plotsize

____

If there is no filter in the front-end I like to show all the entries. But if
there is no value in the number field in the backend those entries are ignored
due to the datasource filter

But this works for now with the unset. I'm more interested in the JIT question
and use of params in the external url. Without that parameter I only got a
thumbnail from the external website.

Ok

____

Yep, JIT can’t handle nested parameters

____

so if the image you are referencing already has URL parameters, JIT won’t know
what to do with them

ouch that is a pity. For the old website I downloaded all the images with a
script, but that way the directory grows every day and old images aren't never
clean up

I wonder if you can do a rewrite?

____

`/media.objectmedia/37182006.jpg?resize=4` to
`/media.objectmedia/resize/4/37182006.jpg`

____

so you can pass the latter to JIT

____

I gotta bounce to bed, but give that a think, might work!
