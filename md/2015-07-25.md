I just tried an install of Integration branch on WAMP Win8x64 and found the
admin folder is named "symphony" and not the custom name selected in the
installer. So produces page-not-found after the installer and when I rename
the folder to my chosen custom url I get 403 Forbidden. Leaving the folder
name "symphony" and visiting that url shows the login box but after logging in
the address bar keeps attempting the custom name. Fixed by changing the custom
name to "symphony" in config.php

@munki-boy if you chose a custom backend name the symphony folder is still
called symphony. All that changes are some variables and the htaccess. You do
not need to change the folder `symphony` if your custom folder doesn’t work,
check your config file, and the `.htaccess` files. Instead of symphony they
should contain your custom `admin` path

@brendo when you have some time can you look at symphonycms/symphony-2#2382 ?
with any more changes required to get this merged?

@jonmifsud it seems it was just the .htaccess file that didn't get the custom
name automatically changed by the installer. So it means in my error the url
made from the config file wasn't being rewritten by .htaccess

I did fix it by manually editing .htaccess but I had a look in
class.installer.php but the place around 526 for Writing htaccess file looks
the same as my 2.6.2 install which worked ok, so I don't know why the install
didn't work automatically. Will an extension overwrite it when it installs?

hmm well this looks straightforward

                 // Writing htaccess file
            Symphony::Log()->pushToLog('CONFIGURING: Frontend', E_NOTICE, true, true);
    
            $rewrite_base = ltrim(preg_replace('/\/install$/i', NULL, dirname($_SERVER['PHP_SELF'])), '/');
            $htaccess = str_replace(
                '<!-- REWRITE_BASE -->', $rewrite_base,
                file_get_contents(INSTALL . '/includes/htaccess.txt')
            );

@jonmifsud sorry was out for a while, in the first example ($rewrite_base) I
got just "mb1" which is the root folder. In the second example I got
"mb1admin" which was the custom admin. So it can see it's in the form field
but it doesn't get written into the htaccess file. I didn't find the bit is in
the installer that puts the custom admin into the htaccess file yet.
