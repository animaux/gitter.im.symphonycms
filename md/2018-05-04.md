Is it possible to do a `starts-with`-filter on a selectbox/association-field
in a DS?

____

E. g. filter for all entries that link to a field that starts with a certain
string?

____

Ot in other words, are regexps possible here? `regexp: ^{$param}`

if not certainly possible with a couple of tweaks

`sql: LIKE {$filter}` seems to work

____

But `LIKE` is not the same as `starts-with()`, ist it? It will match anything
containing the filter-string?

~~If I filter by`association_field`i can either filter by `@id` of the linked
entries or the `@handle` of the selected field in the associated section.
Filtering by other fields in the associated section is not straightforwardly
possible, is it?~~ nevermind ;D

____

But will the DS accept any SQL statement as filter? Or is just a subset
possible?

From the mySQL docs `sql: LIKE {$filter}%` should really match entries
_starting with_ the `$filter`-string. But it finds everything containing it.

____

`regexp:` doesn’t seem to work with associations

But the `related :` filter is even one step further?

the importcsv does export, but doesn't work good for multilanguage

Another easy solution, is just to create a page with all the data on it, and
to copy this data in excel or numbers and save as CSV, or ...
