Maybe I'm going crazy in my exhaustion, but how do you filter a DS to
_exclude_ values? I.e I have a url parameter with multiple values
(one,two,three), I can filter by these with {$url-x} but how do I do the
inverse to include all entries except the ones that match? I could have sworn
this was possible...

i think the multiple values is what the issue is.

What field @pixelninja?

____

I think it was dependent on the field if this was supported or not

Just a standard text input @brendo. If I use not: it only takes the first
value in the array

hmm we can possibly have a look at that logic; I don’t use the text input as
much for negation filters

Yea it seems a bit flawed if I can filter by multiple parameters that match,
but not the opposite.

____

in the mean time, I am trying to create a custom DS that fetches the
information instead. I have fetched all the relevant entries using the
EntryManager::fetch method, but now I 'm unsure how to add the data object to
the $result variable as XML elements. It's been ages since I delved into
Symphony methods, so some guidance would be much appreciated :)

you have an $entry object and need to conver it to XML?

____

This funciton might help you do the trick

____

    
    
     public function processEntry(Entry $entry)
    {
        $data = $entry->getData();
    
        $xEntry = new XMLElement('entry');
        $xEntry->setAttribute('id', $entry->get('id'));
    
        foreach ($data as $field_id => $values) {
            if (!isset($this->_fieldPool[$field_id]) || !is_object($this->_fieldPool[$field_id])) {
                $this->_fieldPool[$field_id] = FieldManager::fetch($field_id);
                $this->_fieldPool[$field_id]->appendFormattedElement($xEntry, $values, false, null, $entry->get('id'));
            }
        }
    
        if (true) {
            $xDate = new XMLElement('system-date');
            $xDate->appendChild(
                General::createXMLDateObject(
                    DateTimeObj::get('U', $entry->get('creation_date')),
                    'created'
                )
            );
            $xDate->appendChild(
                General::createXMLDateObject(
                    DateTimeObj::get('U', $entry->get('modification_date')),
                    'modified'
                )
            );
            $xEntry->appendChild($xDate);
        }
    
        return $xEntry;
    }

____

you need to place this in the datasource: `private $_fieldPool = array();`

____

and finally something like this

    
    
      $procesedEntry = $this->processEntry($entry);
     $result->appendChild($procesedEntry);

____

I have this lying around somewhere I think it should work out of the box

____

I’m pretty sure I stole it from the DS builder

that looks perfect! I did wonder if I had to go over each field individually.
I'll give it a go once babies asleep and I can got some work in :D thanks

worked like a charm @jonmifsud. A couple of minor adjustments and hey presto,
like magic. Thanks a lot.
