Can someone enlighten me please with a programming logic question? In the
`search_index` extension there’s a function declared in
`/lib/class.search_index.php`:

    
    
    public function manipulateKeywords($string) {

However, in this and all other files of the extension `manipulateKeywords` is
never called. Does this mean it is not used at all?

with PHP 7?

It’s in the works I believe it’s 2.7.x (might be mistaken on the branch)

it should be pretty much there ready for a test-drive

Thanks Jonathan; also: I'm quite new to Symphony - do you know if there's an
upgrade guide between 2.3.3 and 2.7? I've seen there are guides on how to
upgrade _before_ 2.3, but nothing after it.

I think it’s mainly because from 2.3 upwards they are namely non-breaking
changes

____

we had started to semantically version it later on before 2.2 to 2.3 was a
major/breaking release

____

ps 2.7 is in Beta so proceed with caution.

@nitriques was working on it to be honest. I’ve had my hands full with other
stuff - namely a client server migration so I didn’t want to add a php
variable in beteen but I hope to start testing in within the next couple of
weeks.

____

probably the biggest task might be to update extensions if there are a lot of
dependencies but the core ones should all be completed

Ah; thanks - I'm aware of the extensions my client is using, so to test: I'll
need to clone the 2.7 branch, replace the symphony, vendor and extensions
folders with the ones from github (and index.php) then start testing out each
of the extensions my client is using, putting them back?

update the core then look for updates for the relevant extensions (as you get
errors) is probably the simplest way

you might get stuck on a few. If you delete extensions you’ll still get
database errors or end up deleting fields (which you don’t want to do)

____

other option is to try set them up in a new `vanilla` install before trying on
your current system

yep

____

it might be a simple way of testing if you wish

____

so you can add extensions one by one but will probably take you somewhat
longer.

____

also if you’re using Git it might be simpler to upgrade/downgrade and switch-
branches/versions for testing

check all of the extensions in use to see if there're anything that're

OK, thanks. So I'm just working my way through some of the extensions, one of
which is custom made by the client and has its own class.db.php - when
building an extension, is there a 'global' db class that should be used,
rather than a custom one?

Any XMLImporter ambassadors around? @brendo Would and XMLImporter helper be
able to bypass the memberspassword field to import previously exported
password data values at all? migrating data from old site in tact is proving a
sticking point with passwords as any exposed XML data will be processed on
import and therefore the salted password altered if I'm not mistaken.?

@iamfinkyuk_twitter I’ve got some sites up and running with the `2.7.0.beta2`.
It is pretty stable and I have actually not encountered any bugs with it. Only
thing is extension compatibility, but most of the the time it’s easy to fix or
there’s a fix already around.

@animaux Thanks Alexander; at the moment, I'm just going through all of the
extensions to identify those which need work. Do you know if there are any
developer guides for Symphony which say how an extension should interact with
the database? I have one custom extension which has its own DB class and I
think there's one already in Symphony. Is that correct?

if you’re going to php7 just a question of extensions in case something’s not

Yes; I'm almost done with my scan through all of the extensions and it looks
like only the custom one is a problem because it's not using
Symphony::Database()

____

A few extensions have been updated to support PHP 7; quite a few have updates
not relevant to that. Is it good practice with Symphony to stick with what
works, or to upgrade extensions always when a new release comes out?

Oh, of course. If I'm submodule'ing the extensions, can I still do a PR
through that approach?

how comfortable are you with git in a command line ?

when cd'ing into the extension folder (ie. extensions/extension) you can add
remotes there. First fork the repo, then add your remote in their. Create a
new branch, commit, push it to your remote (git push my branch) and create a
PR ;)

____

when it gets merge, go into the extension folder, re checkout the master
branch, go out and update the submodules
