@jonmifsud Do you have your fork of `author_roles` running on current Symphony
installations?

Yo! I started recording some videos yesterday, just finished uploading the
first part. Check it out here :  
<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVmJWw5CpcPLzuz8Pn5YkL_MhUXD0JKq1>

I might redo the introduction since my spoken english was just warming up :D

Also, I decided to do a series of short videos on certain topics.

Tell me what you think before I continue ;D

Also, I didn't realize clicking sound is too loud until 4th video, but I'm not
redoing all that :shipit:

@vdcrea lol, didn't even know about that site. I learned xslt on mozilla dev
network, and symphony through documentation. This is cool.

I think this is because you have personalized search results enabled @vdcrea,
for me it's nowhere to be seen.

hey guys, quick question. is there a way to install symphony unattended? say,
from a build script or directly from the command line?
