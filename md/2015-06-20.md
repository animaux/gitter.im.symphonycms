@nitriques I understand happens to me too at times - basically one of my
clients had a redesign a couple of months back and the homepage in particular
has suffered so we’re looking at some tweaks to see if we can improve both the
homepage itself and links back to the homepage. But I don’t want to just make
changes I want to learn if they are working… setup is somewhat complicated by
being a) high volume b) with a varnish/cache layer in front.

I know the concepts of A/B testing but I’m not sure how it’s usually handled
in Symphony, for example would I serve 2 versions, or 1 version add and the
Javascript adds/removes a class which basically decides which version is
visible to the client. (another question is if it should be on a per-
user/session/pageview basis) Any suggestions would be much appreciated.
