Hi guys,  
Does anyone know where the form alert messages are stored so I can translate
them.  
Thanks.

that’s a standard browser error I think

____

in which case no translation is needed

Regarding my question yesterday on creating a unified login with multiple
member sections: adding a simple select box for the usergroup did the trick
(giving the usergroup the `value` of the related members section).

Ah, so the Member has to choose his user group himself? That's by far the
simplest solution!

@nilshoerrmann I thought you didn’t have usergroups as-such… more like legacy
and new clients which didn’t know which group they formed part of - but yeah
that’s a very simple solution in the end :)

@animaux Thanks. I found also `sym_fields_reflection` table which helped me
identify quickly how many and gave me a clue as to where.
