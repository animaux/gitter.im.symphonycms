@michael-e / @nitriques I’m having an issue with something you guys might deal
with regularly. Trying to use ETM/ENM and been a while since I had an email
with funny UTF-8 Chars/Accents. Whenever I preview the HTML Email template for
`Rúna` the `ú` changes to `√∫` any ideas? (debug looks fine btw)

____

oh the email goes out fine though must be not defining the UTF8 in the html...

as in some HTML header when previewing

____

email sending was fine probably because the email headers are handled by the
ETM to set the UTF-8 charset

Yes, it is true that the template's HTML preview does not set a relevant
response header (the plain preview does). This is because you normally define
the character set in HTML using a meta tag (`<meta http-equiv="Content-Type"
content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />`) which should be enough. If you omit
the meta tag, the preview relies on either the server setting a Content-Type
header (which might include the wrong chracter set) or on the client's default
character set.

Guys, I’m getting a strange error while creating entries from the frontend,
also an e-mail is not sent. Not sure if that’s anything to do with the error:

and skipped over that but since the email sending actually works it’s not a

I would be interested if it works if you comment [line
181](https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/blob/2.7.x/symphony/lib/toolkit/class.entrymanager.php#L181),
which is responsible for the new "table locking" in Symphony 2.7. (I added
this to prevent data corruption due to race conditions).

row (which can not work either, but maybe it does not throw such a serious

Yes, probably. The question might be "Should Symhony rely on fields creating
database tables?" But still I am interested in testing without locking. It
might be that you simply run into the next error. Maybe you have a stricter
MySQL setting or version, maybe it even has to do with the PHP version. I
would just like to know if "delete and insert" also throws an error in your
setup. (It should, in my eyes.)

Yes, I think that this should be discussed as a Symphony issue. In short words
the thing is:

____

In your setup MySQL vomits on the fact that Symphony wants to manipulate
tables which do not exist. Symphony has always assumed that these tables
exist.

ETM uses the `EventFinalSaveFilter` delegate which is triggered in the
`__doit` function of `class.event.section.php`. If "allow multiple" (resp.
`expect-multiple`) is used, the `__doit` function is called for every entry.
So yes, I would expect ETM to send an email for every entry.

____

1und1 email server? Why not? It should work.

Like I said, I could connect to that smtp-server via apple mail. I have no
other use for the server on this symphony site.

____

Same happens when using `/symphony/login/retrieve-password/`

____

Found a translation error there `:D` »Diese Symphony-Instanz wurde **n** nicht
für den E-Mail-Versand eingerichtet, Socket konnte nicht geöffnet werden.

Please try to connect to a different SMTP account from Symphony. Maybe the
server port (25) is closed?

____

AFK now, I will be back in one hour.

____

You might try port 587 instead of 25.

I’m on 587

____

will try

____

Thanks

____

D’oh … it works with port 25 … 1und1 explicitly states to use 587 … well,
solved then.

Ah, glad that it works (even if i don't know why port 25 works while 587 does
not).

@animaux Are you able to reproduce the "missing table" case ? I think #2659
will make this impossible

____

@jonmifsud ah great to hear that !

@nitriques regarding @animaux's issue I don't think it is influenced by #2659.
It is caused by a field that doesn't create a data table, see
symphonycms/symphony-2#2663

____

Symphony always assumes that each field has corresponding data table. My guess
is that the issue hasn 't popped up before because PHP 5 threw less (serious)
errors. :-)

Well I am not able to reproduce the problem. It's fine that a field does not
create a table

____

Ah I did not get that I needed to run with PHP 7

That is my guess, yes. @animaux is working on PHP 7, AFAIK.

I 've also accumulate a big backlog regarding jit_manip... I am sorry about
all this, I'll have the time to fix it after 2.7.0

The question will probably be "what do we want Symphony to do?"—see Github
issue.

Jep, PHP7 it is `:)`

____

Forgot to mention that in the issue.

____

JIT is not so urgent since the 1.x versions do run well on Symphony 2.7.x +
PHP7

____

Actually the no-table-issue is the only bug I’ve encountered in Symphony
2.7.beta2 so far. Well done  @nitriques.
