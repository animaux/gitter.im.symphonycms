Dear Symphonists. I’m having SQL-trouble after moving from one server to
another. Never had that before. I get the following in the log:

Probably some problem with SQL-Export/Import. Maybe I should do both again
before nagging here :)

____

Ah, yes, the error comes after trying to save an entry.

it’s trying to insert some data on top of a already existing entry data..

____

seems like the insert is not doing a ‘delete’ of previous data (rough guess)

Does anyone have an archived copy of iwygs versioning extension at all? or
Nick Dunns entry_versions ? Got some client requirements for version tracking
on entries and versioning was mentioned... anyone?

not sure I don’t think

____

though I do have a quote issued for a versioning extension… and a client where
versioning seems to be imperative

it’s something I will be looking into but depends on either of these projects
getting a final sign-off

The EntryVersionsXMLDataSource class needs some love basically.. it's not
returning a built XML representaiton of the entry.

Here it is:
<https://github.com/symphonists/entry_versions/blob/master/lib/class.entryversionsmanager.php#L39>
$entry_xml is empty and is null here

____

It was also required to change this line to adjust for the name change to
class.datasource.section.php file:
<https://github.com/symphonists/entry_versions/blob/master/lib/class.entryversionsmanager.php#L158>

____

And I 've removed the reference to $parent in the __construct() function

don't have write access.

I know what the issue is.. Building the DS XML in the custom XMLDatasource
class isn't returning the entry.. but I'm not 100% why yet.. there's been so
many changes to the core functionality that I need to break it down to
understand where it's failing.

Looking at the history log for the toolkit.. there used to be a
datasource.section.php file. Nick seems to have created his own version of
what the class.datasource.section.php file was doing. I rekon with sme clean
up.. it 's all there.

versioning extension for Symphony. Popped open this chat and there it was in

Haha! well whadda ya know. I still need to do some testing and adjust the JS
to accomodate the 'create new' and 'update existing' functionality, but I
think this should be pretty simple to check over. @jonmifsud was going to look
at this as well if he had time.
