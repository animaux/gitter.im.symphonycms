Unrelated to your current discussion, but out of curiosity has anyone created
a responsive stylesheet for Symphony? I'm keen to make the admin area more
accessible for clients but if I don't have to start from scratch that'd be
awesome :D

It is pretty much usable on mobile devices. Mostly tables are an issue (of
endless discussion).

____

E. g. you don’t habe to start from scratch, but could start with what is
already there just fine.

@wdebusschere I have an open issue #2626 re filtering on empty core text/date
fields if you want to add a plus-one :) I'm not competent enough to create a
PR.

How, if at all, does Symphony handle multiple concurrent edit attempts on a
single entry. I've seen a [Lock
Entry](http://symphonyextensions.com/extensions/lock_entry/) extension, but
just wondering if this is necessary. In other words, is it possible for one
user to overwrite another user's edits during the save process?

@cylkee yes very possible and it happens

____

have multiple users open the same page at the same time (or same users with 2
tabs)

Okay, thought so. Thanks, @jonmifsud. So, is anyone using [Lock
Entry](http://symphonyextensions.com/extensions/lock_entry/) successfully in
Symphony 2.6.11?

Another trip in PHP7-land

> preg_replace(): The /e modifier is no longer supported, use
preg_replace_callback instead

____

Not feeling equipped with this particular fix. Has anyone converted something
like this?

____

There are these two lines in `search_index`:

____

    
    
       $data = preg_replace('~&#x([0-9a-f]+);~ei', 'chr(hexdec("\\1"))', $data);
      $data = preg_replace('~&#([0-9]+);~e', 'chr("\\1")', $data);

Does this replacement make sense? (seems to work):

____

    
    
     $data = preg_replace_callback('~&#x([0-9a-f]+);~i', 
      function($m) { return chr(hexdec($m[1])); },
      $data
        );
    
    $data = preg_replace_callback('~&#([0-9]+);~', 
      function($m) { return chr($m[1]); },
      $data
    );
