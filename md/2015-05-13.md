is there a way to use filters like datasource filters on the remote datasource
. So I can limit the entries from the remote datasource?

Not that I am aware of. Though you could edit the xpath which makes matches to
eliminate entries you don’t want. Or edit the URL by adding parameters if the
third party source allows filtering with url parameters

Yup I tried filering with page parameters. But the performance isn't good
enough (the source is around 200 objects with around 200 elements per object).

hmm because when you get the source it will still be in xml format… so not
sure how you’d gain performance. If you’re caching my best bet would be xpath
within remote datasource

____

you’d only lose some performance on the first time (then it would be cached)

The remote source change every day. So indeed I load the complete xml in the
page and apply the templates with restrictions based on page parameters. Like

    
    
        <xsl:apply-templates select="
            //Object[//ObjectDetails/Place   = //params/place  and
                     //ObjectDetails/Number  = //params/number and
                     //ObjectDetails/ObjecId = //params/objID  and
                     //ObjectSystemID = //params/objectid 
                ]/node()"/>
        </xsl:template>

can you put that in the `$dsParamXPATH`?

____

within the datasource where you choose the xpath to output? you should be able
to use the parameters there. (granted you will hit the server for each url)
but you can cache it and reduce the computation from being done every time.
Unless you want to try customize something.

yes I think that’s the name in the frontend. obviously for params you would
use $place instead of //params/place

____

also using // might be a bit more expensive than outlining the full path so if
you have a lot I would rather put /data/dsname/Object

____

as the `//` would be going through all your nodes to find a match

@brendo & @nitriques Debugging the profile script on `class.frontendpage.php`
I’m trying to use the total profile time to get some values out the below
doesn’t seem to make sense:

    
    
    columnists on seed    1.13606787 s from 20 queries
    columnists    0.00001097 s from 12 queries (profile lap value)

@brendo & @nitriques seems like the profile logic for datasources is at least
partially wrong. Pre execute and post execute delegates are called in
‘between’ the profile - which is correct. but the Seed is reset for each of
those calls. I’ll probably send a pr I guess 2.6.x would be the appropriate
place right?

Part of the elements are optional so I was looking for a solution to use the
remote source directly . For single entries there is an unique id. That works
through a page parameter and I can display all elements that are not empty.

____

But the visitor should also filter all the entries based on multiple elements.
I think now that is beyond the purpose of the remote datasource

by default that resets the seed value.

to track for a new ‘profile_lap’ doesn’t take into condsideration context from

@brendo Yes I still have problems with the remote datasource

`/ObjectenLijst/Object[ObjectSystemID= {$objectid}]` (numeric value) works but
`/ObjectenLijst/Object[ObjectDetails/Adres/Nederlands/Woonplaats = {$plaats}]`
(text value) doesn't work

____

`/ObjectenLijst/Object[ObjectDetails/Adres/Nederlands/Woonplaats = 'Place']`
(static value) works also

____

Another problem is <http://ozp.moretaste.nl/dev/test/1459419/> works (id is
set through url),
[ozp.moretaste.nl/dev/test/](http://ozp.moretaste.nl/dev/test/) (no id set)
