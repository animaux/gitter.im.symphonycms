for a custom datasource is there a quick way to determine a field id?

yes, normally I save the datasource and copy the custom lines back

ok let me find what I use :) there’s a function to get the id from the field
handle

ah I tend to use the inspector in that case the publish forms / table views
contain the field ids

____

<http://www.getsymphony.com/learn/api/2.2/toolkit/fieldmanager/#fetchFieldIDFromElementName>

____

I use that function within a datasource if necessary

____

it makes it simpler if you don’t want to get the id every time

____

    
    
     FieldManager::fetchFieldIDFromElementName($handle,$this->getSource());

the extension still works.

Ah I did inspect the datasource editor and section editor not the publish view
:-)

____

That function sounds handy, but I prefer id 's in case I change a name

editor works too - but the id is in a more akward place to spot.

____

In most cases I use id’s where possible avoids the extra query but at times I
want/need something handy it’s useful

Mmm I've got a custom sorting like:

____

    
    
              <xsl: sort  data-type="number" order="ascending"
                select="((load/item/@handle='light') * 1) +
                        ((load/item/@handle='medium') * 2) +
                        ((load/item/@handle='heavy') * 3)"
                />

But that gives trouble with pagination

I guess that would mean your datasource cannot be paginated properly right?

so you want to sort by heavy/medium/light? and paginate?

____

what I mean is to sort them you need all entries in the XML

____

otherwise it will sort the ‘part’ you have visible

it seems so but there are 200 entries so I'm afraid it wil give performance
issues

____

and I need to write a custom pagination, 200 entries on a mobile phone isn 't
really handy

yeah I understand

____

to do it in the datasource I guess might be a bit cumbersome, not sure if you
can just modify the order by query manually. since they’re linked to fields

yeah haha

____

my suggestion (for quick solution)..

____

customize your ‘execute function '

____

get the totals of entries which are ‘light’/‘medium’/‘heavy '

____

set the ‘pagination’ thresholds at that point. so say the first X entries are
heavy the next are medium the rest are light.

____

then customize the dsParam to pull in only “one of light/medium/heavy” and
offset the pagination accordingly

____

it might mean if you have to run the ds component twice if you have two types
which overlap

or I make a reference field that translate light, medium, heavy to a number
and sort on the reference field
