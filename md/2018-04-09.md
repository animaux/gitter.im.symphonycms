Is a `3.0.0 RC` on the horizon?

Pretty nice! I wonder how hard it will be to get the most important extensions
working with `3.x.x`.

____

Will all the SQL-stuff in extensions break?

Hi all,

I am trying to fix the Custom Field Captions extension. At present it has
display issues because the caption fields are added to the section UI by
javascript, but the height of the field “drawers” does not expand to fit the
extra field.

I’d like to change the height of each field by adding 55px on click of “Expand
all” button and remove that 55px on click of “Collapse all” button. I have
observed that I need to change the “max-height” property on click of “Expand
all” and “Collapse all”.

@nitriques has investigated this and gave me advices, but we have been unable
to find a solution.

Can anyone please suggest a creative approach which might work for this. May
be via CSS?

Sorry, nevermind.

I always felt that _Custom Field Captions_ became obsolete at the moment the
field-handles were not generated from the field titles anymore. Thus you can
use a short and handy handle and use the title as an explanatory caption.

____

But usecases differ of course.

____

@nimanthaharshana it’s hard to tell where the problem is, without looking at
actual code or better: a running site.

____

I could imagine using CSS to switch between a single-line caption (via
ellipsis) and a multiline-mode. But since there a predefines heights involved
the problem seems to be somewhere else.

@animaux it will break a little in 3.0.0, but most "should just work" with the
compat layer. But with 4.0.0, it will break

____

it should not be that hard to upgrade
