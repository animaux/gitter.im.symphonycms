Damn. I've accidentally created a branch in the Symphony repo at Github
instead of making one in my fork. 'mysql-regex-link'. I'll try to delete the
branch now...

I can't delete the branch (at least not at the Github web interface), so I
created a pull request for it instead. Can you delete the branch when it's
merged please? Sorry about doing it wrong. I'll be more careful in future.

____

(And I 'll probably do more locally and avoid making edits in the web
interface.)

Is it possible to use the following datasource filter on a text input field?
`not-regexp:^{$ds-datasource-name.email}$`. I'm filtering against email
addresses, and I think the issue might be that the email addresses need to be
escaped. Or can `not-regexp` not be used with parameters from another
datasource?

I'm even struggling to do this in XSLT. `<xsl:if test="email != /data/params
/ds-datasource-name.email">` isn't stopping the relevant entries from being
shown.

(With or without `/item` on the end.)

If you have multiple entries, thjis won't work. You must use `not(email/item =
/data/params/ds-datasource-name.email)`. Every node gets evaluated, so it is
not the same.

Thanks! It seems I need the `/item` on the end of that. So: `<xsl:if
test="not(email = /data/params/ds-datasource-name.email/item)">`.

____

So the XSLT method is working. Problem solved. I 'd be happy to know if it's
possible in the DS, but no biggie if not.

Well, two serious questions – I haven't followed the Symphony development for
a while:

  1. Is there finally a roadmap what to expect in the next releases?
  2. Are there any plans to offer some kind of core API to access entry data from the front-end easily?

I've been playing with Craft CMS and they offer something similar with their
`ElementAPI`.

@brendo had a comeback and plans recently too.

@nilshoerrmann I know that @nitriques has identified someone to help him work
on the core over the coming months but I haven’t been involved in a detailed
roadmap so far. We will be trying to see if we can unlock some funding (EU
based) for R&D etc allowing us to dedicate more time.

Re access of entry data from the Frontend kind of customising your DS I
presume?

I was thinking of something like DS 2.0: similar to the [Rest
API](http://symphonyextensions.com/extensions/rest_api/) but as a core concept
that's used internally for data source output and externally to query data
directly.

I’m pretty sure I created something to speed up certain custom datasource
reports, so that might be pretty-close to what you’re after.

Then I had an actual datasource which extends that with a bunch of `clever
filters` no UI but could be easily adjusted.

    
    
    public $dsParamFILTERS = array(
        'date-of-birth.from' => '{$url-fields.year-of-birth.from}',
        'date-of-birth.to' => '{$url-fields.year-of-birth.to}',
        'gender' => '{$url-fields.gender}',
    );

____

it’s just a minor adjustment on top of the existing datasources… allowing a
bit more complex filters / easy setup for new reports

Maybe, I mean MAYBE, I can help with some ideas for a templating layer. As you
may know, my "big system" is using frontend publishing exclusively, for
hundreds of authors. So I have utilities to help building forms (and
outputting validation). The main issue is: It should be re-written to be
really elegant. :-)

Where can I find your email address? I could send you something to look at,
but please never publish this. It is not open source, and it was my first take
on this matter, so it's far from elegant.
