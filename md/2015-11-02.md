@nitriques @munki-boy itâ€™s not MY extension, I forked it from @nilshoerrmann
and only simplified the paths a bit. :)

Looking at the forum recently it feels more and more like the community is
very slowly starving to death :(

@jonmifsud Allen will be at Web Summit if you decided to go :)

@munki-boy The regex is slightly off for what you wanted to achieve, although
you had `e?`, the regex still was anchored with the `$`.

Thanks everyone, I'm OK-ish with regexp. I just wanted the extra element added
to the default text in the core (I think as I didn't see it in the extension)
so that others who work with images frequently didn't have to add it in the
section given the rest of the vanilla jpeg suffixes are included already.

____

I decided to stop asking for it to be put in the core as it was causing
everyone else more hassle than me just writing it directly in the section
setup.

____

Big thanks to everyone as usual for your patience, I try to just read rather
than comment :)
