Quick question: the page to which a datasource is attached isn't in the
datasource file self?

nope it’s in the database

__ __

there’s a db entry `per-page` which comma separates all the datasources it
contains

__ __

look for `tbl_pages` in the database replacing tbl with your prefix default is
`sym`

exactly it’s just the storing of the ‘relationship'
