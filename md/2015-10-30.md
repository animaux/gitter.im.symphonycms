@bernardodiasc yes documentation always has been a problem. WE need to
automate it...

____

@munki-boy yes it should be possible... doesn't the unique upload field
extends the normal upload field ?

@munki-boy: The Unique Upload Field extends the core Upload field, so you
should see a validation rule in your section setup. As usual. If this is not
the case, we have an issue.

@nitriques @michael-e I can find the validation rule in the Section but
although it says this:

____

    
    
    /\.(? :bmp|gif|jpe?g|png)$/i

____

Somehow the  "jpe" part doesn't seem to work and produces an error

____

    
    
    File chosen  in ‘Image’ does not match allowable file types for that field.

____

If I rename the image to end with .jpg it does work as expected.

____

This way does work

____

    
    
    /\.(? :bmp|gif|jpe|jpg|png)$/i

Could someone make the default to be the working way or alternative that you
might think of? I'm thinking the default code there is coming from the core
that I shouldn't change :)

The defaults are just suggestions, and you can change them however you want as
long as it's valid REGEX expressions, of course.  
`.jpe` is not a valid suffix for JPEG, as far as I know. But if you really
need it, there are several ways to do it.  
Let me explain the default: `jpe?g` means that the `e` may or may not be in
the string, so this expression will match `jpg` as well as `jpeg`.

".jpe" is one of the valid extensions to represent jpeg format and is found in
industry standard apps like Photoshop. I don't use it myself but some places
like Twitter do, and so incoming client images have this extension in my
current build. I expect it's happened as it's more consistent with shortening
"jpeg" by removing the last letter rather than removing a random letter from
the middle. I'm fine to edit the rule in the Section but, given it is a valid
extension, the generated error is incorrect.

____

Sorry if it 's unnecessary hassle, just seems like we have these other image
types in the field. Here I've revised the code (thanks @michael-e )

Michael is right

____

Symphony only validates de filename, not the content itself
