@nitriques No worries! I just quoted that from a MAD-TV sketch about Steve
Jobs presenting the first iPhone `:D`

I could use a scotch. I have been trying to configure HTML panel field and am
getting Apache errors when the panel renders. See above. I have tried full
domain names, HTTP, HTTPS.

The page I am loading through HTML panel loads fine from other Sym sites on
other servers, so there seems to be some problem with the loading of the URL
on this site and/or server.

I can load the page through the command line on this server using curl. So the
server can load the page, but the HTML panel field cannot.

Any thoughts welcome :-)

Sym 2.7.6  
PHP 7.1  
Apache 2.4.18

@stuartgpalmer double check the url

____

looks like you are loading something like <http://test.com:443>

Yes, I considered that, but am using a correct full URL, and as I mentioned,
if I load the URL from another Sym site (same software versions) it works. I
have examined the Apache config to the nth degree, and can't see an issue
there.

____

It seems to be an issue with loading the page rather than serving it

____

BTW, if I try to load an HTTP page I get:

I just upgraded a website from 2.3 to 2.7.6, but in the `website-owner` and
`navigation` DS I get two errors: the page seems to be looking for
`datasource.navigation.php` instead of `class.datasource.navigation.php`

____

This is the long version:  
<error>include(/Users/user/Sites/mysite/symphony/lib/toolkit/data-
sources/datasource.author.php): failed to open stream: No such file or
directory</error>
