Sort first on a field and after that on another field is also some 'surgery'
needed I think. Or just an extra sort in the template?

good question. I think with XSLT you can do it - not in a datasource though.

____

you could use a concat in XSL (not very nice)

    
    
            <xsl:sort select=“ concat(field1,field2)"/>

i think in the xslt will be ok, but I was afraid if pagination goes right. But
in this case the second sort is always the second

____

no concat needed it is first sort on field 1 after that sort on field 2

it just sounds cleaner when all the sorting is in the datasource

You can use multiple <xsl:sort />s

____

    
    
     <xsl:sort select=“field1"/>
    <xsl:sort select=“field2"/>

thanks for that - thought so but the first one that came up was a concat
(strange) assumed I was wrong - didn’t use xsl sort in a while.

This is also a wonderfull trick with sorting in a specific order with a
weight. Only not dynamic anymore

    
    
    <xsl:sort  data-type="number" order="ascending" 
                select="((./@handle='budget') * 1) +
                        ((./@handle='regular') * 2) +
                        ((./@handle='premium') * 3)"
                />

@brendo was reading a thread regarding some updates to the cachable datasource
+ cache interface. And it was mentioned that it might need some reworks - for
example namespacing etc. Is that something worth putting time in?

____

Need to cache some datasources to improve website performance - just wondering
if I should be spending time to tinker with that or if there’s something going
on already.

@jonmifsud do you remember this discussion
<http://www.getsymphony.com/discuss/thread/108181/>

Wouldn't it be nice if you could make a filter optional already in the core?

Namespaced caches are available since 2.4 I believe

____

But the update was never done to Cacheable DS

alternative title

@brendo ah ok I was looking at:
<https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/blob/master/symphony/lib/interface/interface.cache.php>
it should be updated to match I presume right?
