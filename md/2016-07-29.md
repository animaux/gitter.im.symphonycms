ok, ok... I feel stupid now. How do I filter items by multiple tags without
making custom event? I thought it was enough to create custom multiselect form
that generates this kind of url :
`fields[tags]=Blue&fields[tags]=Brown&fields[tags]=Interesting` but that just
takes the last value of `fields[tags]`. This format also doesn't work
`fields[tags][]=Interesting`, it just creates bunch of nodes like this :
`<url-fields.tags.1>Tag 01</url-fields.tags.1>`, `<url-fields.tags.2>Tag 02
</url-fields.tags.2>`

I think so not sure I’ve one it before but I know what you mean i did the
1,2,3 thing when I nad a max of 3 before.

____

but we should really provide a url-fields.tags (in a comma separated format
for the url params)

____

I guess if you do {$url-fields.tags} it doesn’t work?

work

I usually used JS for that kind of stuff so I never paid attention to it

____
