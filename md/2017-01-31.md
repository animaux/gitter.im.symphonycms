@diomed there’s a lot of good stuff. I need to delegate more to my team and
package these nicely with a proper tutorial. The Symphony Tutorial is a goal I
have to wrap up by end of Quarter. I’m not sure on the format yet.

Um you just need to create XSLT templates

____

unfortunately there are way too many variables for us to be able to give you
exact steps/guides. But assuming you already have a theme/website… you should
have someone familiar with it

I am again wondering if you refer to a CMS based on the _Symfony Framework_
which is not _Symphony CMS_?

But (last try) guys what about jit and caching. And ofc the status of 2.0.
@cmnstmntmn also reported that 2.0 is not production ready for nginx (or is
this due to a caching setting, etc.). I love the functionality of jit but no
browser caching for performance is for some clients a no go. (this question is
not symFony related btw :D)
