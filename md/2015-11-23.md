Quick question about <https://github.com/michael-e/storage>. If I want to
store an amount with a product, what is the best practice? I would prefer to
keep the group name for a cart and user settings. So I can display a count of
the items in the cart.

From my understanding (and this is how I used it) all amounts are managed
outside of the session context.

____

you basically want to store that the user has ‘1 tshirt’ in his cart. and
maybe if you have colours that would be ‘1 blue tshirt’ then it’s when you
render the page using a datasource that you would provide the amounts/totals.

____

You don’t want your amounts to be ‘adjustable’ by someone playing around with
your session data.

ah found it already you can nest the attributes like `<input
name="storage[cart][product][number][count]"/>`

Hmmm I don’t recall how I had used it, if it required a custom datasource or
if the param output was there.

hmm maybe it’s using a deprecated function?

____

if you want to temporarily fix it go manually in your datasource

____

find $dsParamPARAMS and make that equal to 1

it’s not the output you’d expect then I guess

____

if you’re using  > storage[cart][product][number][count] - your output should
be [product] at least that’s what I understand with the current setup

All those options <https://github.com/michael-e/storage/blob/master/data-
sources/datasource.storage.php#L53> got the css class 'irrelevant' so they are
hidden through css (display:none).

____

I guess would be best to file a ticket so it’s checked out. I’m not exactly
sure why they would get a class irrelevant though. For the purposes of your
site would editing the datasource manually work to output the param?

            // Show only relevant interface components based on context
            components.addClass('irrelevant');
            components.filter('[data-context~=' + label + ']').removeClass('irrelevant');

That went wrong. Almost there :-)
