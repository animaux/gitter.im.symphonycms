I have two instances of Symphony 2.6.11 and problems with reflection field. On
one, nothing is being saved in the reflection field (no error, no log). On the
other I am getting an error when I save the entry:

`Symphony Warning: DOMDocument::loadXML(): xmlParseEntityRef: no name in
Entity, line: 9 An error occurred in /var/www/asia-
decs.com/public_html/extensions/reflectionfield/extension.driver.php around
line 91`

Has anyone else had problems with reflection field recently?

@stuartgpalmer are you using the lastest version? What types of fields are you
building your reflection on?

@stuartgpalmer Yes. There was a breaking change in 2.0.0 (see release notes
<https://github.com/symphonists/reflectionfield>) but I had an issue with
XPath functions here symphonists/reflectionfield#31 Might not be related
though. What version have you installed? Should be good now in v2.0.2. PS,
@nitriques Should the v2.0.2 change log say 'XPath functions' instead?

@stuartgpalmer Reflection field 2.0.0 introduced some breaking changes, but
also some bugs and quirks in the way xpath-expressions were processed. Some of
these were fixed in 2.0.2 but these fixes came with other breaking changes
(and bugs) regarding xpath-expressions. So as the behavior of different
versions of reflection field became a little bit confusing I just started
testing and documenting the differences regarding xpath-expressions here:
symphonists/reflectionfield#35 (might be a helpful resource for anyone having
trouble with reflection-field's xpath-functions right now)

I hope @nitriques is able to fix the remaining issues listed there (I tried
myself but didn't succeed) and we can release a proper working update (3.0.0)
soon - I'm also planning to update the documentation to include more infos and
examples regarding the use of expressions.

@nitriques that would be great! I extended my tests today, updated the
comparison-table and summarized what needs to be fixed for a major update -
doesn't seem to be much but I couldn't manage it myself.

hehe... I also don't always have this patience - but sometimes I just feel the
need to gain a kind of "complete" overview of what's going on. And as I'm
relying on reflection field in every project I'm building this was the case
here - I just started a new project and felt like I finally needed to
understand what was going on with these damn expressions ;)

But if it 's helping you fixing these things it's all worth the effort!

@twiro I've replied on the github thread, the only thing that needs updating
are the docs/copywritting!

@nitriques I'm not really convinced yet that the current behaviour is really
what we should aim for... I replied at
<https://github.com/symphonists/reflectionfield/issues/35#issuecomment-313148255>,
but would also really like to hear @nilshoerrmann 's thoughts about this
