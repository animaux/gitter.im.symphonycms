An option _could_ be the ability to switch columns on/off in index view. Like
in iTunes `⌘-J`.

____

Would become messy with a lot of columns too though …

shaved off an average of 0.7s from the server response time for my major
client yesterday - GA confirmed it :)

@animaux Yes, search works per se, but the interface isn't optimized on mobile
at all. Filtering is quite a chore when not on desktop; it's definitely a
bottleneck when it comes to quickly finding content

I see. One thing is probably the many clicks involved in creating a set of
filters.

____

That might be an interesting design task for  @nilshoerrmann who mentioned he
likes things to become more app-like.

the MetaData section you mention is something the developer built it does not

@cs_php_testing_twitter though it isn't total up to date but this:
<https://github.com/x-team/symphony-tutorial> will give you the big picture of
symphony. In the short:

  * you have sections which holds te data/content. 
  * datasource are filters for the wanted content which you attach to a page. 
  * all the data which is available is visible by adding `?debug` after the url.
  * xslt templates which you can find in the workspace directory, mostly in a subdirectory utilities, are the way to transform the data for the front-end.

That section manager doesn 't look bad for 2011.
