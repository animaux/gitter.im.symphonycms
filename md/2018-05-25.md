I need to put clothes on a website of a client, but have no time for designing
a template from scratch. How do you make it in these cases? Do you have some
fav place where to get WP templates for example? Or static sites'?

@Manaus We have a default template based on the uikit framework
<https://getuikit.com/>, similar to bootstrap. which allow us to prototype
very fast.. after our designer adds the styling/design elements

____

@Manaus We don't buy templates as they mostly give more work than just making
it from starter template

just add the uikit css, js, and html code and mix with your xsl and you have a
site

@andrewminton use the `to` so essentially put a filter which has `{$fromdate}
to {$todate}` and that should do what you want.
