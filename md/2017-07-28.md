Hey all. Does anyone know why JIT Image Manipulation is corrupting images? I
found an open issue from last year: symphonycms/jit_image_manipulation#151 \-
any thoughts on how to handle this, other than downgrading?

@pixelninja My company also does also bet a lot on Symphony since 2011. There
are plenty of ways to help. This is a nice starting place:
<https://github.com/symphonists/symphony-extensions-network> and it does not
requires coding skills ;) If you want to code tho, issues taggued minor in
github may be a good place to start

@iamfinkyuk_twitter Sadly, right now the only way would be a downgrade. I've
been focussing on 2.7 since the past year and did not get anytime to fix up
2.x, which currently has a major perf problem
