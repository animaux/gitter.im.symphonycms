@mosin771098 I’m sorry, then this is the wrong place to ask. This here is all
about **Symphony CMS** which is not related to _Symphony Communication
Services_ in any way.

____

@nitriques @wdebusschere Maybe `Symphony 4.x` should get a new name. _—ducks

@mosin771098 »I’m afraid« is just an
[Idiom](http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/i-m-afraid). Jon
means to say nobody here has any idea about _Symphony Communication Services_
, since this gitter room has absolutely nothing to do with it. Therefore you
will have to ask for help somewhere else, sorry.

____

Since [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_Communication) is around
too now, I’m really starting to feel our good old name »Symphony CMS« is
becoming a slight problem.

Hi folks, looking for a bit of advice on JIT Image Extension... I'm developing
a site on the latest version of Symphony.

When using JIT `master` branch I am effected by this bug:  
symphonycms/jit_image_manipulation#121

So I switched to the `integration` branch which fixed the above but I believe
I am now effected by this bug:  
symphonycms/jit_image_manipulation#151

Any thoughts?

@jean-luc I can second that you should use `1.46`. This works fine even in
Symphony `2.7.0.beta2`. All higher version numbers are not stable yet.

When chaining datasources, is there a way to keep the sort order of the ids
passed via params in the second datasource?

____

Let’s say I have a first DS that outputs my 3 entry-ids:

____

`$ds-entr-ids '242, 239, 172'`

[May 30 2017

If I set up a second DS filtered by `$ds-entr-ids` I have to give it a new
sort order.

____

Simplicity!

____

I can fix this by including the linked entrys in the first DS an parse the IDs
there, but this kind of messes up the whole simple concept of a chained DS.

____

So I figured it would be nice if I was able to simply keep the right order
that is set up in the first place anyway …

@cylkee don’t think it is related. The order of the DS params seemed right. My
(circumvented) problem is to keep this order in the DS which is filtered by
this particular param. Seems that is not possible.

@animaux I don't think that what you expect is trivial with MySQL. AFAIK, the
order of a MySQL response is random by design unless you use `ORDER BY` (which
wouldn't achieve what you want either).

____

This simply means: You must achieve your desired order in **the last** of the
chained DSs (or in XSLT, which won 't work if you want to paginate results, of
course).

So how can Symphony be vegan?

I will buy a snake leather briefcase at least before I do a test install. You
never know what happens. I should at least try to fit to the new Symphony.

This is self-explaining.

____

BTW, this is indeed why the  "big project's little sister" is called "Snake".
It was supposed to be built with Python, but in the end it was Symphony. But
the nickname remained.
