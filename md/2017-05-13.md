@nitriques this may be of interest: a version of an XSLT 3.0 compliant version
of Saxon, Saxon-C, is now available for C/C++ in Linux and shortly for
Windows, and as bindings for languages such as PHP and node.js

____

@peterfleck_twitter @animaux \- see my above comment -it seems a binding for
php already exists for XSLT 3.0 I haven’t looked into it but would be a very
timely upgrade

____

seems like there’s both linux and OSX versions out there already:

@nitriques they do have an open source version no?

____

as in they don’t let you bundle it within another application if I understood
correctly

____

(though I just skimmed through)
