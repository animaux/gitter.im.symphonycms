hmm; you are not calculating any distances by any chance?

I don’t think so, but I’m not sure when this function is actually triggered.

could it be just the high volume of entries?

That’s the question. Is 8s normal for ca. 5000 entries?

____

With such a simple output as seen above?

____

The DB queries are not taking up the time, so I’d think it’s rather something
else.

____

I think the distance-stuff is only triggered when filtering by that:

I’ve already commented out lines 230-242

you should be able to get a better breakdown by datasource

There are only two. I know which one is responsible …

____

`geo 6.8266 s from 9 queries`

____

But when I look a »Database Queries« there are only miliseconds involved …

Well, no luck finding any smoking gun. `cacheabledatasource` does the trick
though :clap:

Wow. I have only just stumbled upon @nitriques symphony template and am very
impressed by its complexity and modularity. Have to dig into that further.

Guys, weird issue with JIT and a jpg file. Is there a file height limit
enforced with any JIT manipulated image? currently nothing over 2500px in
height will crop. I thought the limit was 3000px?

@andrewminton the limit is the available RAM

____

let 's say you have a 2000px x 2000px image. This will use 2000 x 2000 x 4 x 2
bytes of RAM

____

4 channels, two images

@nitriques I have to look at your template and will probably need to share
mine at some point..

@andrewminton we also advice our clients not to upload images larger than
~2000px

____

Without that nice calculation that seemed to be a good rule of thumb :·)
