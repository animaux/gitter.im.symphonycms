@zlatkovtv hopefully because you realise that creating stuff in raw html and
php is cumbersome, inefficient and highly ineffective. If you have an
interface where clients or staff can update content on your website you
already use a CMS. The beauty in Symphony is that you’re using something which
has been tested and used before, and it does it in a very elegant manner. It
also gives you something ready which you can use rather than having to start
from scratch, but the latter really applies to any pre-existing cms.
