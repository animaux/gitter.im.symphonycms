Correct me if I'm wrong, but this whole method seems a bit convoluted doesn't
it? Getting the entry in the first place is easy thanks to the
EntryManger::fetch method, and with the build option it creates all relevant
fields for that entry, so it would seem to me that there should be another
method that easily converts that data to xml for attaching to the result for
outputting. Having built that data, only to then loop over each field to then
build the data again, seems verbose...

@pixelninja I believe I took that off the Datasource function but stripped off
a number of things. Each field has it’s own XML build function; and in a
datasource you usually don’t necessarily want all fields to be output (hence
the loop) - but also because each field is responsible for their XML that you
want them to return the relevant XML. Probably you could just call this
function within a datasource context (but I actually needed it in an event… )

it might have been that his was not a standalone thing but part of something
‘larger’ too I don’t exactly recall
