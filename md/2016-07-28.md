Btw, is there a way to group entries by date and than get sum of a certain
field without making custom DS or doing it with XSLT?

@reygoch you mean sum a particular field across a set of entries? doing it in
XSLT would seem the simplest option, something like `<xsl:value-of
select="sum(entries/entry/value)" />`.

____

with the grouping done in the DS settings

I don't think we have a ds which does summation

____

Though it would be a possible addition with an extension I 'm investigating
the options as I need totals for paginating stuff

making.

____

I was hoping we have some less known extensions that allow for elegant map /
reduce on our data sets.

@reygoch does it have to do with the fact that `/data/params/page-types` are
grouped in `<item>`s?

@reygoch next week I’ll be working on this we’re building a web-app on
symphony and we need to take care of the totals

____

unsure if I’ll do it by extending the SectionDatasource (most likely) or an
extension or a custom DS

I’m having some similar calculation stuff for a meal-ordering site for a
school. It’s only a small school, but it generates a lot of queries … plus
XSLT-calculation … not very quick.
