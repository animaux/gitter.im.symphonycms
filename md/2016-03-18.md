@michael-e, I recall you had opened a ticket regarding changing update/insert
code. Is
[this](https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/issues/2472#issuecomment-143007830)
the only change you have or am I missing something else? Looking forward to
trying it out on a project which is giving me a bit of issues.

is rather old

saving on change, and had a couple of odd occurances. hopefully that sorts it
out.

@animaux / @nitriques I think yes it’s exclusive. I don’t know if there was a
reason in particular it was added to the core rather than the extension
itself. And I do have some questions regarding associations as to why some
things are in the core, when they are association specific.

ah! that explains why I guess

____

but then again he had split it into 3/4 extensions. and the UI is clearly only
one of those so I’m not sure if he meant for them to be extensions bundled
with the core or actually to become part of it for good. (pretty sure you have
objections to the latter)

There’s probably some discussion between Nils and Brendon about that buried
somewhere.

I still don’t understand the remove_button issue well enough, so my pull
request might be a bit to quick.  @nitriques

I think the idea behind having 4 separate extensions was to make it possible
for others to do their own interfaces. Especially John Porter had some very
different ideas about how associations should work (drawer, etc.).

Hmn. The updated `selectize.js` does create a remove button for single selects
but a different one in a different place.
