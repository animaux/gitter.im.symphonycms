@michael-e Can it be that this
(<https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/issues/2627#issuecomment-254804954>)
is the reason why I only can login when I delete all browser cookies? On this
server I have both production sites on https and dev sites on http. It only
seems to occur in chrome

The dev sites are as a subdomain of my own domain. The subdomains loaded the
analytics code from my domain. Setting analytics to https for my domain solved
it as I can see now. I think it was idd something to do with 'mixed mode'

Yep, I also assume that the mixed mode has caused this.
