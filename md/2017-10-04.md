@pixelninja I remember testing that one out quite a few years ago and found it
not very reliable even when it was up2date. Would be nice if youâ€™d give it a
spring clean or even start a replacement from scratch.

Hi All. I need to import a CSV of users into a site using the members
extension. Ideally I would import passwords too so that the client can email
each member their password. I was thinking of using XML importer and remote
datasource to do the import, but I suspect this will not work with password
imports as they need to be hashed on the way in. Does anyone have any
suggestions either to streamline the import or to deal with passwords please.

@stuartgpalmer We have a symphony site with a membersection, we managed to
export the members to csv and import them into the new version of the website
with importcsv, including hashed member passwords

____

Soon  @nitriques and @michael-e will add a better importcsv extension

Thanks @wdebusschere. So the importcsv extension works then? Last time I tried
it it was not working. Do you use any particular branch?

@stuartgpalmer i once had to do the same thing; i manage to import them by
creating an ajax/post to the register event

____

so you loop the csv data (you may choose to transform into json), and for each
entry you posto to the ajax page (having the register event attached)

Hi all,  
Is there any way to get current Logged-in member id to the event? The event is
custom event which generated by extension. Need to get current member id when
execute the event for trigger another function.

You can even get all the params using
`Frontend::instance()->Page()->Params()`.

____

So you can simply do:

____

`$params = Frontend::instance()->Page()->Params();`

____

`$member-id = $params['member-id'];`
