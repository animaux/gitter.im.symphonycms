Regarding the below, From what I can tell is if a page is accessed/refreshed
consecutively within a minute then the association output doesn't show at all
in xml output of the following load - only the reflection field information.
It's an issue no matter how many fields I include in the Association Output.
Then for it to show again I need to wait for at least another minute before
accessing the page. Anyone have any idea how to even troubleshoot? I don't
even know where to start.

> I seem to be having an issue with Association Output extension on Symphony
2.7.7. Using Association Field 2.0.2 and Association Output 1.2.0. What I've
noticed is that when I 1) load the page and then refresh shortly after (within
5 seconds or so) or 2) load the page in one browser and shortly after load in
a different browser, the Association elements aren't included in the XML -
it's like the Association Output breaks.

> Anyone had this issue before? I'm thinking I could bypass the issue using
browser caching but where I get worried is that it will be an issue if two
users access a page shortly after one another (which I think I simulated using
two different browsers which browser caching won't help).
