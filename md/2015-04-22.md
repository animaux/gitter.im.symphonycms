I can see a couple of things

(don’t know if there’s been a recent update) had the client asking because it
wasn’t pulling up search results.

__ __

I have updated by filters branch

__ __

I think it does the trick

basically passing handle-based search to handle fields in the db - helps
improve results

@brendo Autocomplete search on associations UI has been giving us trouble over
`’` and `’` I figure it’s a selectize issue. It seems like adding it into the
DIACRITICS array does the trick - would that work for you?

You could yeah! Symphony::Author() allows you to get the currently logged in
Author so the value can be extracted on save of an entry
