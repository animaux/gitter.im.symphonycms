@jonmifsud last time I got an error due to php 5.3. Now I have with the xml
importer also een error: Symphony Fatal Error: Call to a member function get()
on a non-object on this line `$type = $field->get('type');`. Is that also due
to the php version or something else?

work up to see what’s getting that. There should be either a `field id` or a
`field name` which should then be converted to the field using symphony

____

either when you migrated the ID is different or you have something with the
field names. my guess it’s ID’s but I’m not looking at it right now

Bi-Link to Association works the same as here

But you can then probably get rid of one side of the bi-link and let the DS
side do the job of connecting/filtering the entries.

Please think twice! If you drop the rewrite rules for the JIT extension, your
first thought may be to hardcode "something" into Symphony's index file — no
good idea, because JIT is just an extension.

Well, you might think about adding an `image` folder to the root with a
dedicated `index.php` when JIT gets installed, but this would mean that JIT
would need write permissions for the website's root folder.

I don't mean to drop the rewrite logic, but to drop the automatically
modifying the .htaccess file.

____

There 's other ways to do the rewrite logic.

With Apache, for example, it's recommended to place these directives into main
configuration files, because parsing for .htaccess files consumes some time.
And I am using Nginx so it's completely different syntax.

____

So this .htaccess updating is a convenience feature, and I 'm not even saying
it should be dropped, but I don't think it should be automatically fiddled
with

Thanks for asking. I have several options in my head at the moment, in
decreasing order with my preferences first

    
    
    1. If .htaccess is detected, create a notification if .htaccess file is detected and ask if the user would like to update the .htaccess file
    
    + Fast
    + Simple
    + Non-obtrusive, if I don't want my .htaccess to be changed then it's not changed
    - Some users maybe don't notice it
    - No way to do the rewrite without uninstalling the extension for a moment
    
    
    2. Always do the rewrite when .htaccess file is found
    
    + Fast
    + Simple
    - Obtrusive if I don't want my .htaccess to be changed automatically
    - No way to do the rewrite without uninstalling the extension for a moment
    - May not work if there was no .htaccess before, which is unlikely
    
    
    3. Add a button to extensions for updating the .htaccess file
    
    + Extra step
    + Not obtrusive
    + Can do the rewrite without uninstalling the extension for a moment
    - Adds clutter to preferences, esp. if some other web server is used

What about 2 + 3 ? Auto add but offer the option / button to remove/re-add it.
I think most of our users would prefer to not be bothered about knowing what
it modifies the .htaccess.

____

but if someone doesnt’ want to add it they can ‘undo’ the changes so to speak
and re-add later if needed.

That's an option. I will create a ticket about it as JIT is a core extension
of Symphony and I want to hear what the users have to say

Well, there are pros and cons… But: Symphony is compatible with Apache
officially, so I personally don't mind that the `.htaccess` gets updated
"automagically". nginx users will know what to do **if they only know that JIT
attempts to add a rule**. So why not make it clear in the README (and maybe
even suggest an alternative rule for nginx there)?

It doesn't crash (I fixed it a while ago), but it's still trying to write to
it even if it doesn't exist

____

So 1) it assumes .htaccess is writable 2) if it is writable then I get garbage
in my filesystem because Symphony makes an assumption about my server
configuration

I need to create a link so when a category is clicked on it reloads the parts

ok so what Id usually do is add a ‘filter’ to the datasource and a ‘parameter’
to the page named `category`

then I would add the filter to with the `$category` parameter to filter out
the rest. being brief as a bit late and about to head off…

I am really confused about the JIT code. :D Is it just me, or is does update
logic assume an exception is going to be thrown?

                     try {
                        $htaccess = file_get_contents(DOCROOT . '/.htaccess');
                        $htaccess = str_replace(
                            'extensions/jit_image_manipulation/lib/image.php?param={$token} [L,NC]',
                            'extensions/jit_image_manipulation/lib/image.php?param={$token} [B,L,NC]',
                            $htaccess
                        );
                    } catch (Exception $ex) {
                        if(!file_put_contents(DOCROOT . '/.htaccess', $htaccess)) {
                            Administration::instance()->Page->pageAlert(__('An error occurred while updating %s. %s', array(__('JIT Image Manipulation'), $ex->getMessage())), Alert::ERROR);
                            return false;
                        }
                    }

Not to mention these PHP functions don 't even throw exceptions, unless in a
relatively likely case Symphony has some error handler that does some magic in
between.
