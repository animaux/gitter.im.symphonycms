Hi Tilo!

____

@animaux: Good to hear that! Regarding 2.7, @nitriques and still have an open
discussion. :-) But it's not related to email/ETM stuff.

____

This one:  symphonycms/symphony-2@58bc57f It's a bad issue (for @nitriques),
and a monster discussion (for both of us).

____

But I am rather sure that 2.7 is not far away. I am glad that you dare to run
the beta. Unfortunately, I can not deploy it to my production systems (because
of extension issues).

I have started to run and clean up the Symphony code with `error
reporting(E_ALL)`. This may take a while… But I have the feeling this could
really improve the code. @nitriques: If you want to try this yourself, I can
send a PR with the first bunch of changes—so we don't have to fix the same
things.

I’m sure you guys will come up with a sensible solution.

Sure! @nitriques said: If it walks like a duck and it sings like a duck, it's
a duck. (I still wonder: how can he know how I sing?)
