@bzerangue That’s generally because SQL sorts on text differently to numbers.
If those two values are stored together I’m not sure how to get it sort
naturally.

____

The SQL sort doesn’t accept regex as it just maps directly to SQL’s SORT BY
functionality

Having a Google around, doesn’t look good!

____

Is it possible to separate the integer from the text as a separate field?

____

Or is it just a fluke that there are multiple John’s?

One of my clients got still spam with the can of spam filter. Do others have
that also? I include the event to the page, event filter to the specific event
and the hidden field is filled in with the hash.

If the client wants a “solution”, a honeypot could be added to the form. It’s
not 100% bulletproof (especially if the spammer is a real person), but it
might help

____

Ah, yeah  @bzerangue, I google for natural sorting in MySQL and the solutions
are very specific to the actual data set

Yeah  @moretaste, I’ve done that before on a site, just created a hidden field

@bzerangue is a custom order in your xslt template possible?

____

`<xsl:sort data-type="number" order="ascending" select="((./@handle='budget')
* 1) + ((./@handle='regular') * 2) + ((./@handle='premium') * 3)" />`

____

Above is how I fixed that once, maybe you can split the number from the words
and use that as multiplier

@moretaste \- the issue is that my datasource needs to be much larger... i am
paging through every 7 results on my site... but i have more results and need
to order with mysql. I can accomplish with XSLT after the fact when result set
is larger. maybe i should do that and then bring it in as a dynamic/remote
datasource.

____

@brendo @moretaste \- i am dealing with thousands of entry, so an order field
wouldn't work; the mysql route was the first route... but looks like i will
need to do the remote datasource (pulling from a symphony generated page with
a large dataset so i can properly order the items with XSLT

@bzerangue no problem. Natural sorting with thousands of entries sounds hard.  
Time to make an honeypot for me :)

@bzerangue as brendo said it’s a bit complicated, you basically have bible
verses which need sorting? so in your value you always have John 1, 2 etc? or
it contains other values as well?

____

I’m thinking maybe there’s away to a substring and cast that into something
else, or else, add a custom script within Symphony and add two ‘meta’ fields
which can be used for sorting. (name and verse) separated but client would
only see John 1 on the frontend

@nitriques @moretaste I’ve used Javascript/ajax based submissions without much
issues. (ie binding the event to another symphony page) - Though I know it’s
not most people’s first choice.

Intersting, I got hold of a client with a 2.0(beta) which had duplicate
database entries for some fields, every once in a while not sure if it could
be related. (Migrating to 2.6 next week) so i’ll keep this in mind if it keeps
happening.

This is a 2.0 alpha or beta built by Allen & Co, I came across as they’ve
assigned a bug to me - (apparently it happens every so often) - what happens
on the client side is that the content gets duplicated. for that particular
field, I can’t remember if it appears twice in the datasource but probably it
did

I never really dug into it to be honest, as I had already started the
‘migration’ process when I was aware of it, and certainly not now. Most likely
time to look into things will be After May 4th.

btw while we’re here, there aren’t any Symphonists around Russia/Moscow or
Paris area?
