__ __

On it’s own that’s a bit difficult to debug… you have the full SQL query?

An error occurred while attempting to execute the following query  
SELECT SQL_CACHE value, field_756 FROM sym_entries_data_756 WHERE entry_id=

You want the whole query log?

no just the query with the error. usually it helps identify a few things.

did the query just finish `entry_id =`?

the error there should be something like ``

order entries seems to be the one that gives trouble, not association

without required fields I got this at the end of the query (for an empty
entry)

    
    
    [0.0001] SELECT SQL_CACHE * FROM `sym_fields_order_entries` WHERE `field_id` IN (756);
    [0.0001] SELECT SQL_CACHE t1.* FROM sym_fields AS `t1` WHERE 1 AND t1.`location` = 'main' AND t1.`parent_section` = '5' ORDER BY t1.`sortorder` ASC;
    [0.0001] SELECT SQL_CACHE * FROM `sym_fields_uniqueinput` WHERE `field_id` IN (35);
    [0.0001] SELECT SQL_CACHE * FROM `sym_fields_input` WHERE `field_id` IN (251,253);
    [0.0001] SELECT SQL_CACHE * FROM `sym_fields_textarea` WHERE `field_id` IN (252,254,650);

I doubt now if it is order entries. I have no required fields but still got
the error with an empty entry. When I fill in the title (unique input field)
it is ok.

Maybe it is <https://github.com/symphonycms/uniqueinputfield/tree/integration>
that gives the problem

It's handy to be sure an handle is unique for building the url

that’s true, but last big project I had they wanted the entry id in the url,
and generated the handle via customization of the Entry URL field. looks
pretty neat but I have no unique checks.

ah ok

but I think those changes were merged to integration

I guess if you’ve already instaleld it, seems like a mysql table type /
coalition issue
