@nitriques Hi. sorry for the late. Yes currently it's working only with the
symphony events. if you want to use it with member login. you should do some
hack like first fire another event with reCaptcha and trigger the login event
if reCaptcha event success. BTW i'm trying to do some fix on it will update
the extension after that.

@michael-e it's returning null, is there any tool kit to use to
"frontend::instance()->Page()->Params();" on extension event file ?

@SagaraZD I've created another extension for the login use case. Your event
filter is good! And when the PR gets merged, I'll be able to release the
members_recatcha extension ;)

____

@nimanthaharshana if you want to do it via php, this can help:

@nitriques Also do you have any idea why this return null on the extension
event file ?

`$params = Frontend::instance()->Page()->Params();`  
`$member_id = $params['member-id'];`

Do you have a member-id page parameter defined on the page you are testing ?

____

I would not personally tie page params with events: or at least, be able to
handle the case where the page does not have a page param

Yes. but in this case i have no chance to get member id. coz it's a curl
request to other event while executing the main event.

____

And for your question: Yes, member-id page parameter defined on the page
