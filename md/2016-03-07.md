hey folks, how's going? I made fresh install from bundle branch + workspace,
everything goes fine until I try to login, I get access denied (Request was
rejected for having an invalid cross-site request forgery token.), any
suggestion?

There have not been any changes to the session/cookie stuff recently.
Nevertheless I checked out the bundle branch and did a fresh install on a
remote web server — without any issues. So it must have s.th. to do with your
local install on a Mac. Just guessing now… I remember that once we had issues
with certain browsers in local environments. Can you try a different browser?

Nice to see this recent stream of extension updates on the extensions site,
even if it’s mainly because of the version information :sparkles:

@nitriques: There is one remaining issue with the extensions site: Extensions
belonging to an organization can not be removed (but they can be added).
Currently @nilshoerrmann would like to clean up, but he can't remove anything.
(The Storage extension, for example, is maintained by me, so we would like to
remove and re-add it.)

I have a couple of @nilshoerrmann’s extensions too which would need migrating

@nitriques, thanks for doing all of that.
<https://github.com/brendo/default_event_values> has its integration branch
updated but not master.

____

I just migrated the SSM fields to Association ones, and things are still
working. :) I 'll take a look at the UI enhancement extensions next. Thanks
again for the all the guidance, chaps.

____

@nitriques, whoops, that's not one you've updated anyway. Never mind.

Yes, correct, it's @brendo's extension. There are open pull requests, and
there is still a discussion in
<https://github.com/brendo/default_event_values/pull/15#issuecomment-191349373>
about the correct positioning of the interface. I hope that @brendo finds the
time to look at it.

Got it. So you couldn't bump the XSRF input down to the bottom of the form?

This would be a change in the core that could — theoretically — break other
extensions.

@michael-e @jonmifsud please create an issues here:
<https://github.com/symphonists/symphony-extensions-network> it will document
everything permanently

____

@DavidOliver I do not have write access to @brendo's extension so I am afraid
I can't help on that

so just to be clear: If you want to delete or replace an existing repo that's
under a org account, create an issue to tell it to me ;) Being able to delete
as an org would require to much efforts
