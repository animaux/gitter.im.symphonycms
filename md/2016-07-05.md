@brendo \+ @nitriques: So we now have at least four similar but different
approaches to Symphony Next presented in this thread. Who is in charge of
bringing these ideas together creating a unified concept? How will these ideas
be communicated? Who is taking care of the different parts? What’s the rough
timetable?

____

I haven’t been around here for while now but I know these discussions and the
ideas are too good to let this become one of these „Symphony 3 discussions“
with the plot just dragging on but never coming to the point of actually doing
something.

agreed! from my understanding @nitriques has someone ready to work on the core
for the summer months - so that should speed things up

Has that been communicated somewhere? Not just here in the chat (noone can
actually really follow older discussions here).

____

I’d really like to see some kind of a roadmap: We have this concept. We’d like
to start this way. X is taking care of this, Y is doing that. We expect
development to take 1 to 2 years.

Has anybody ever thought about a hard reboot, moving the current website to
`archive.getsymphony.com` and starting with something new that just focusses
on sending people to the right places (Github, Gitter, Symphony Extensions …)?
Could be called **Symphony Encore** : taking the still brilliant ideas behind
Symphony 1 and 2 and reimagining them with modern concepts (as already
highlighted in the Gist above).

hmmm not really - I was investigating the Factory stuff which you guys set up
- plan to work on it this summer

but that wouldn’t significantly change the structure of things. - what I was
thinking maybe was a push via api from the forum to Gitter.

Something like the „Activity“ sidebar here on Gitter would be helpful for
Symphony: a timeline of what’s happening. This already existed on the current
Symphony site but it never really worked reliably

The community was supposed to be a general timeline:
<http://symphonycms.github.io/factory/docs/examples/community.xml> – See the
extension listed in the table. It currently works the same when you add
extensions on the main site not on symphonyextensions.com

____

If you’d like to work with Factory, take the body of the layouts section as a
starting point: <http://symphonycms.github.io/factory/docs/layouts.xml>

I think they were supposed to be separate installs but the main site but
everything was supposed to exchange information via APIs

____

There once was the idea as well that the main site provided an API for
extensions that the extension table in the backend could call to check for
available updates

yeah that’s a nice addition I am not sure but I have a feeling some extension
exists which can do that kind of thing at least I’ve seen it mentioned a few
times here

____

I’ll check in with  @nitriques on this should have an intern coming in which I
can hopefully dedicate to working on the site rebuild whilst we discuss
overall strategy of re-invigorating the community

The problem of Factory was, that at the time when we were seeking for feedback
each and every maintainer of one of the sites at that time (symphony,
extensions, network) was either looking for a new job or just started a new
job. All discussions stopped abruptly. It was very sad to see this project
die.

____

I’ve been told if I want to do just take the ‘lead’ and ‘dictate’ if no
feedback is recieved

which given how far you’d gone with designs will probably have to be how it’s
done.

It only makes sense to work on designs when you or someone else works on the
implementation at the same time. We never had server access which was one of
the reasons this more or less ended as an academic exercise

And taking the lead is the only way to go ;)

yup I’ve already been in touch with @nitriques on this - just need to get the
resources/throuhput to see this through

as soon as we want to start we should have the existing data-set available to

Personally, I wouldn’t migrate any data. Just create an archive and start from
scratch …

____

Trash all that network stuff from the old site, let people register with their
Github accounts

____

Think about the future Symphony and let the old Symphony be the old Symphony

Create an unexisted site that looks great but focus on writing: let people

ah so I guess we’d leave the old forum behind and start afresh. that would
certainly be simpler. I’m sure you’ll see comments around here as I’ll try to
take that into a new level and agreed re github login - was at most going to
allow a ‘link’ to associate content to the right person but without migration
(At least to start with) that would be far simpler

Simple series of video tutorials on core symphony features would make wonders
both for documentation and popularity. I'm not PHP dev, more of a C# /
JavaScript guy so I was thinking of making some more coherent video tutorials
during my vacation on Symphony to help popularize it a little bit more and
help out in the process.

@nilshoerrmann I can't answer all of your questions, but just let me say that
right now, I am solely focusing on releasing 2.7.x, which will be a LTS
release. Right now, it's hard to find time to just fix bugs, it's impossible
to create roadmaps of the sort.

____

Code is king. Code is the best documentation you can get. Code gets results.

____

That being said,  @brendo is currently experimenting with pretty cool stuff.
We still need to experiment on the way we can decouple the system into clear
concepts, which you already know and love

____

I 've played with many, many CMS. I my eyes nothing comes even close. Yes
there are limitation, but I've always found ways around it

____

Communication is an absolute necessity to make an open source project a
success. That 's my biggest problem, since I suck at it. I try to make the
best of what I can do. I am really open to let anybody do things on the
communication side of things ;)
