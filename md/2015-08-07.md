Thanks guys! Could y'all help me with a basic datasource filter? Surprising, I
haven't really every used the NOT filter is that possible. Basically I have a
checkbox called `only-use-feed`, how would I go about saying I want everything
that does NOT have checkbox `only-use-feed` selected

set the datasource filter value to “no"

as far as I’m aware a checkbox would be “yes” on checked and “no” on false

Yep and if the default state is also ‘off’, that’ll pick up entries that don’t
have any value
