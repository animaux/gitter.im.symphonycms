Hi all, can someone please give me any clue regarding how to change the max-
height of "field-inputs" when I add a field (via an extension) to each field-
input in a section. I can add max height within my extension, so that it'll
set the max-height on document ready, but the problem is that when I click
"Expand/Collapse", the max-height will be set to initial value.

@stuartgpalmer @nitriques might have been a nasty combination of both `;)`

Any Custom-DS/mySQL-people around?

I have the classic unique-tags custom DS:

____

    
    
             $tags = Symphony::Database()->fetch(sprintf("
                SELECT DISTINCT(handle), COUNT(handle) AS count, value 
                FROM sym_entries_data_%d 
                GROUP BY handle 
                ORDER BY handle ASC
            ", $this->dsParamFIELDID));

____

My question is, can I simply further narrow down the list of tags by only
showing entries that are linked to a specific section via association field?

____

E. G. only show unique tags from entries linked to a section called »The
Beatles«.

____

Where »The Beatles« has an ID that is passed in an URL-Param.

What's the best way to disable members from logging on with the members
extension? We gave the members section a checkbox field with the name active.
And filter our member datasource with active=yes, but they are logged in.

Honestly, I don't understand the question. What has logging in to do with
filtering a data source?

@animaux you would have to either issue a fat INNER JOIN statement in that
query, or poke at EntryManager::fetch() a couple of time to get the linked
entry ids

@wdebusschere if you have login enabled unless you have public roles set up
properly users will always be able to log in

____

Member ID will show;

____

then its up to your template logic (or other logic) to show/not show pages

@nimanthaharshana the height is controlled in javascript. You might be able to
do it by listening to the 'updatesize' event

____

<https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/blob/master/symphony/assets/js/src/symphony.collapsible.js#L266>

____

or set size
<https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/blob/master/symphony/assets/js/src/symphony.collapsible.js#L276>

____

@wdebusschere you could also create a little extension that handle the
'MembersPreLogin' delegate:
<https://github.com/symphonycms/members/blob/master/extension.driver.php#L961>

____

Simlilar to this:
<https://github.com/DeuxHuitHuit/members_login_twitter/blob/master/extension.driver.php#L74>

____

BTW  @/all `2.7.4` is out

@nitriques »fat INNER JOIN« sounds a lot like a great pain `;)`. Guess I’ll
have to learn how to use `fetch()`.

`fetch`is a lot of pain and will require you to either issue lots of calls or
give him your inner join ;)

____

or wait for `3.0.0` to get a MUCH nicer API

As @nitriques said (see above), you will have to play with an extension that
hooks into a Members delegate, if you want to disable login.
