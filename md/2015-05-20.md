I've do some filtering with selectboxes and submit through an ajax call. In
that way I can show a little load animation and the url-parameters are shown
in the url. Only disadvantage is that there is a small flash (page build) when
the form submits.

With `replaceWith()` it is smoother but that way the url parameters are not
shown in the url (I like that so people can share or bookmark the complete
link).

Does anybody know how to prevent the 'flash'?

If it’s all by AJAX, which form is submitted?

____

Could you make use of the HTML5 History API to replace the URL state once the
AJAX request comes back?

@brendo sorry to hijack the conversation. I’ve just got a version of Cachable
DS using the cachable interface and cache database… any specific reason why we
run optimise on each delete? It pretty much killed the servers when I put it
live (removed the offending line since)

@brendo thanks that was one at my list to check for. I submit the form (3
selectboxes with categories to filter entries) to have the get parameters in
the url and I do it with ajax only to show a loading animation (got some
performance issues first but change some things)

History api is from IE10, a no go for this client. Maybe I just have to ignore
the flash :-)

@moretaste maybe you can use hash tags? If you look at history.js it has
support for older browsers using # instead of the full url but it would still
work

history.js looks like a solution, ty
