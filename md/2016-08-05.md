woah! 25 videos?!

do you find includes useful? I’ve never really used them… found imports and
modes far more poweful

don't want to overdo it :D

@jonmifsud I like simple things, and includes are just that. Never really
needed imports in any of my projects so far.

mostly

I actually use symphony for prototyping, than I make app from scratch in
nodejs or something

btw, has anyone done some work in Haskell? I've been learning it for the past
year, and it's absolutely amazing!

aha :) that explains the simplicity I guess

but you’re actually missing out on a ‘lot’ of ‘power’ some time I need to find
the time to make the bad-ass stuff :)

Haskell? Cool. Once I was kidding with @allen about re-writing Symphony in
Haskell. Unfortunately I never found the time to look into Haskell.

well, it's declarative language, kind of like XSLT so ti would be a good fit
:D

although I'm still not impressed by DB support

new client builds in symphony and curious as to how good documentation is as a
lot of links are broken on the site and current documentation dates back to
2009....

Hi @brendenmartin05 ! The 2009 is mostly still good ;) But yeah some parts are
lacking

@nitriques Thanks for the response! Looks like I gotta get creative in finding
more documentation. Thanks for the heads up.
