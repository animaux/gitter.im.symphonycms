Solved the `_fields` issue. `2.3` used `$this->_fields`, but `2.7` uses
`$this->_settings`.

Now I have another issue, which is what happened to
`Administration::instance()->saveConfig();`, which is used _everywhere_ in
this site 's extensions. :/

In Symphony 2.4 `Administration::instance()->saveConfig` has been removed, and
you must use `Symphony::Configuration()->write()`. See

Developers>
