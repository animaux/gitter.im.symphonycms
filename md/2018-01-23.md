@wdebusschere do you have the `members` extension running?

Might be members interfering with the REST api. Do you get any corresponding
entry in the Member Roles / Public page?

____

You could try deactivating members temporarily.

I have never used the REST-API. Does it work as a Datasource?

____

Or a page?

____

Or as something of its own?

I can get data, but not post, probably because of the member extension

Ah ok. Is a symphony event involved when POSTing data?

When you mentioned the error you get I instanly had to think of the members
extension. All new events and such need to be allowed for the member role
»public« there. I guess this might be the case here too. But I might be
totally wrong …

Ok, but no event is created for this post, i just post to
api/entries/sectionname

____

without the members extension it works, just tried this

Ah!

Is there any option/setting related to the POST API in the member roles/public
page?

so the members section is inteferring automatically, which is good news,
probably means i can just add some acl code

:thumbsup: Joy!

____

You might want to use another Role as `public` though :)

____

The Authentication is via a symphony author? Then it’s probably `public`.

yes, but this will need to be according to the member role, as the platform
making use of the api will also use the symphony members

____

Authentication is with the token of a symphony author
