@SagaraZD \- does this project by any chance have an HTTP and HTTPS version?
If so make sure you use the https version - iâ€™ve found some quirks when having
a website working on both protocols.

@jonmifsud Actually it's working only with the HTTP for the moment.

I am saving html in a text box field. The field is set to markdown so that I
can output html (using formatted output in the datasource). When creating
entries in that section manually in Symphony the outout is html, however when
creating entries from a form the html will be encoded like `&lt;h1&gt;`. Would
you consider this a bug or is it intended?
