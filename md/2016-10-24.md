You mean ETM? You can use `{$etm-entry-id:$id:0}`, for example. Which means:
"Try to filter by `$etm-entry-id`; if that is not set, try `$id`; if that is
not set, filter by `0` (which means an empty result)."

`of $id`? AFAIK, this is not Symphony DS filtering syntax.

I have never seen this in a DS filter. A logical `or` would normally be
written with a comma, e.g. `{$etm-entry-id},{$id}`.

Sorry, I think that I don't understand the question. You mean ETM (not EMT),
right? What do you mean by an "entry link"? Can you elaborate?

yeap, your right, ETM

____

inside _simphony/templates/email.entrycreated.tpl_

    
    
     Dear <!-- RECIPIENT NAME -->,
    
    An entry in the %1$s section was created or updated. You can view or edit it by going to: %2$s

____

there are placeholders for _section_ and _link_

____

in ETM template i ended up doing something like this

    
    
    <xsl:variable name= "entry-path" select="concat($ds-order/section/@handle, '/edit/', $ds-order/entry/@id)" />
    
    <a class="btn-primary" href="{$root}/dashboard/publish/{$entry-path}" title="View order">View order</a>

Are you using the ETM with an event filter? In this case the entry ID of the
saved entry is available as `$etm-entry-id`. That's in the README.

indeed, i filter with `$etm-entry-id`

____

i only wanted to know if there 's an easy way (as in the default template) to
auto generate a link inside the template

____

in my case, i had to create from scratch

____

the question was if there 's a way to add

____

    
    
     Go to dashboard entry : %2$s

inside ETM template, to generate link

It’s fairly easy to create the edit link

____

I don’t see why symphony needs to pre-generate it.
