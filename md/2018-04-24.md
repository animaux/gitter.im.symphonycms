@nitriques we :pray: to `officially` launch a big SAAS project in the next
couple of weeks based on Symphony. I would hopefully be available to start
doing some more throughough testing - or at least start assessing the damage
to the whole eco-system of extensions which I’ve built to get them working
with 3.0 / your huge PR.

@jonmifsud are interested in transitioning the `association field` and it’s
interfaces into symphony 3.x.x? I’d be happy to join forces on that one. Maybe
we could meet halfway regarding my partly [redesigned UI
fork](http://symphonyextensions.com/extensions/?keywords=Materie&type
=&compatible-with=&sort=updated&order=desc).

@jonmifsud Wow that's super! If you have problems, I will have time to
review/rewrite the docs

@animaux yes I’d be up for it. I’ll just need to finish this payroll software.
We’re going through QA right now and it’s kind of a nightmare when the local
laws are not clear cut and everyone has their own opinion… But yeah I’m
heavily reliant on the Association Field for Major projects.

Also I _can_ likely sell this PDO Upgrade/Testing to a large client if I can
show possible performance improvements.  @nitriques you may help me in making
that case… especially if I can have a master-slave setup for read/writes with
this PDO.

nice! - other than testing how far do you think we are from being `production
ready`? As I can easily make a case for me testing this to the client if I can
swipe off 25-50% of his RDS server costs by using a proper master/slave
architecture.

@jonmifsud it depends on the time I get to try it in at least 2 of my new
projects...
