I have an RSS feed as a "Remote Datasource" and an "XML Importer" to import
the content into sections. However the "XML Importer" is run manually. Is
there a way to check if the latest RSS <item>'s pubDate equals todays date, if
so run the XML Import and import the RSS item into the section?  
ie. I don't want to run the XML Import manually but also don't want to import
the latest RSS <item>'s unless they are new today.

Thanks.
