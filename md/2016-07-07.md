@reygoch that's a good idea. if you don't know, there is actually group for
[symphony cms videos on vimeo](https://vimeo.com/groups/symphonycms/videos) to
which you can contribute :) but of course, putting them on youtube too would
probably produce better results.

@diomed Sure, I'll upload them on both sites. I'll have my vacation after the
next week, and I plan to cover all core features, some useful components and
explain MVC concepts and XSLT for the newcomers in the process.
