Reflection field doesn't work when you use xml importer? Or am I wrong?

possible it’s missing a delegate

what misses a delegate?

____

reflection only works on a save, I can imagine xml importer doesn 't do the
save but write directly to the database

not exactly

____

the XML has a delegate which allows extensions to run on save/create of
entries

____

logic is pretty much the same as the usual save/edit so it’s just about adding
the delegate and correct funciton in the Reflection field

____

look at
<https://github.com/jonmifsud/entry_url_field/blob/integration/extension.driver.php>
for an example

____

this is URL Entry which is a slight alteration on the Reflection Field and I
have those functions

        array(
          'page' => '/backend/',
          'delegate' => 'InitialiseAdminPageHead',
          'callback' => 'initializeAdmin',

                array(
                    'page' => '/xmlimporter/importers/run/',

                    'callback' => 'compileImportFields',

XML Importer

can you add a field in the XML importer

____

yes wait a second let me explain :)

____

that statement is trying to do an ‘update '

____

when you save via front-end; the ‘field’ is saved with blank/old/dummy data

____

so the ‘update’ would find the wrong value and replace it

____

if the XML importer creates no `empty` value

____

there is nothing to update

____

so my guess is best is to add a new field in XML importer to insert some blank
data into the reflection field

____

you remove the commit and it should magially work

@nitriques and me are trying to fix that stuff, starting with the Hashid
Field, also discussing delegates and inner workings of the Reflection Field
and the XML Importer. So if you stay tuned, we will hopefully have something
that doesn't need any "tricks". :-)
