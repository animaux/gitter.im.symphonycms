@michael-e Probably an edge-case. I had an `association selector interface`
with an image preview plus text generated by a `reflection field`. Apparently
while creating the entry, the reflection field took the whole (larger than
255) string and integrated it into the proview, whereas the text field itself
truncated the text. This of course left the impression the whole text was
stored in the â€¦ except it was only in the reflection.

I understand. So it's not a bug in the Input Field. It behaves as expected.

Github just introduced "topics" and it would be cool if we could agree upon
using the same terms for labelling our repos - would be nice to get some
feedback from all extension developers out there: symphonists/symphony-
extensions-network#11
