@nitriques do you have a rough timeline for a `2.7` release?

@jonmifsud Is my description understandable? mazedigital/association_output#13
:)

__ __

Is it possible that the possibility of selecting multiple sections to pick
entries from in the ai interface is only rather experimental? @nilshoerrmann

Hmm I recall being able to select from multiple sections… though it might be
somewhat experimental

Seems so. At least it’s not compatible with the XML-output

__ __

Still quite handy for some use-cases.

__ __

Think I’ll simply fetch the XML via an extra DS then.

I think the editor works; the output you’re right as that would join with 1
section. multiple sections make that a bit more tricky

In either case I would _highly_ recommend chaining vs using the output

__ __

it gives you far more templating flexibility

The old conflict: lazyness vs. flexibility

it depends on how you structure your XSLT really

It’s always nice to have all these endless possibilities how to handle things.
Which makes it hard to answer support questions from people taking over sites
developed by others though :·D

__ __

Caution, very bad joke: In Symphony 3 all `@handle`s will be renamed `@händel`
because of the obvious symphonic context.

yeah I think we just need to share some good practices where things start
working like magic with XSLT

So instead of 'finishing' the admin stylesheet extension I was working on I
started taking things in a different direction :smile_cat:

Not finished, but I think something like this has potential and I'm definitely
going to get it finished and released as an extension hopefully quite soon.
