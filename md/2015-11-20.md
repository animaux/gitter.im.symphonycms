@michael-e can you let me know when you’re around have a question regarding
#2315 \- just to check/confirm all the steps I’d need to do in order to
support utf8mb4 - client is asking if I can support emoji (at least in some
fields)

@jonmifsud today I am only around a few times, for some minutes.  
I haven't done such a database change, so I have no practical experience.
Everything I posted on Github was from reading and/or thinking.

The tricky thing is the indexes, as far as I remember.

ah ok, yeah indexes seem the tricky part.

____

I’ve just swapped one table, and seems to work fine. No issues I can see but
I’ll test it a bit more before putting it forward to the client. I did update
the issue on github with what I encountered so far.

I saw your post. Maybe you can write down the steps you take? We might create
a Wiki page for such a change, then think about adding the collation setting
to Symphony.

yeah sure, I’ll see if I can get @nitriques feedback on the handle-related
part. and I’ll pen down the exact steps.

____

It was changing a table’s charset to utf8mb4 and changing the values in
`class.mysql.php` to set the utf8mb4 charset.

Be careful, especially read Step 4! <https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/mysql-
utf8mb4>

Maybe I can help with the Wiki page. (As you may know, I have a very big
system running which is supposed to be updated to Sym 2.6. I might switch to
utf8mb4 when the update is done.)

oh good point! the table which I changed was already converted to Long Text…
had to import some entries which were a bit well, too large to fit.

____

I did have a complaint relating to varchar(255) being in the index but over
1000bytes after converting, so it didn’t do it, which then led to an issue
with the length of existing content which would need trimming if I want to
keep it in the index.

Yep, these are the issues. You may delete and re-create this index (shorter
than before, I don't remember the exact length, but the DB wil tell you…). I
don't know, however, how useful such an index on a longtext field might be at
all.

the index was a on the ‘handle’ field of a texboxfield table. (that sounds a
bit strange to say)

____

I don’t use the handle but seems like it creates it anyway just in case I
change my mind...

On the handle field? So it might be useful if you filter a datasource by
handle (to have clean URLs)!

I have to leave the desk, will be back later.

yeah but not on this particular field used for body content. It has an option
to enable/disable handles. but generates for both just in case someone
switches it on/off by mistake I guess.

____

ok ttyl and thanks for your time  & feedback
