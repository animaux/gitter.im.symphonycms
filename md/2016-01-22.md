I have just made my first calendar list of events in Symphony for a job I'm
on. I used a list of all the events and a list I made of all dates - that is
each day of the year. I sent each date through to a small template using "with
param", and compared it to my list to see if it was just a day, or an event
day. I then "draw" the calendar by applying a link and styling to those dates
that do have at least one event. It's working fine and not slow because we
limited it to 6 months of future - they are small casual events that don't
require "booking". If anyone isn't too busy please could you briefly post if
there's a better way I could have done it? As in what would you more
experienced people have done. Just a few key words will do.

you just want a calendar + a list for events?

____

I’m not sure I understood but did you do a datasource to pull up all days
within the period?

Hi Jon, do note it's working fine already. I've done two DS, one is like a
regular calendar the other is just the events (that is physical ones for
people not Sym Events) and I compared the dates in my Xpath using "with
param". So I get a date then send it for comparison to see if it's got at
least one corresponding event date.

____

Just wondering if you would have made a custom DS or something like that. I
used just Symphony Bundle extensions.

I think it was an overkill (the first datasource), I did have a calendar
somewhere and I believe there was an XSLT Utility to create the calendar

____

then just plug in the other 2nd datasource with your data for rendering. If
you have performance issues worth looking into

____

not sure the one I was going to send you is actually being populated via
javascript I think

Ah, I was thinking about that but didn't want to drag in some other "unknown
quantity" from things you can find on Google. I agree my all-dates DS is
overkill. I made it by dragging a date down in Excel. I was also thinking
about querying something like "$today + x" in my xpath - if that's possible.

@nitriques, @jonmifsud: Maybe yes, but this baby meant damned hard work in the
past years. Nevertheless, I love having my own "product". It feels better to
me than selling "services" only. (BTW, I would never have built this without
Symphony. And, theoretically, if I ever leave Symphony I would still say that
it was Symphony who taught me everything.)

to have, having a ‘product’ is on the wishlist but it’s a compromise between

@nitriques it creates fields on-the-fly? I'm using KML that I can make with
some GIS and read it in as XML (with namespaces) and that is working at the
moment. I'm making poly-lines to show on maps, but I'd like to have the points
(value pairs) editable directly in the backend. I might try to make an
extension because it's only like two number fields then something to make it
repeatable.
