Does anyone have experience with storing credit card information? Security is
essential obviously, is there a way with Symphony to store an encoded value
which a client could then decrypt? Use case is a form with a CC field for
membership payment (which is set up internally, not though a gateway which
would be easier sigh).

@pixelninja: I would probably make my own gateway and make a very thin
extension in Symphony to integrate that....

gateway.... Just use right tool for the job ;)
