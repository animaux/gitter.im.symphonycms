Coming back to check out if Symphony has changes anything, well, it looks the
same?

Itâ€™s pretty robust most of the things remained the same - a few changes under
the hood did happen though.

I see, I remember after 2.0 went live and I went away for good. to settle for
Laravel, now that I feel PHP is a messy language and remain problematic for
plugins and frameworks.

p.s. There is a big deal going on Swift programming lang for web server, that
I wonder why not consider Swift to get SymphonyCMS more performant and safer
coding?

Functional programming and protocol is more fun to learn than XML and ability
attract programmers to improve algorithms give the performance is near native
C to run on mobile app, tv, web browsers.
