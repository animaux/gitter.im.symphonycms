Hi All,

Can someone please tell me why I'm getting this error when upgrading Symphony
core from 2.3 to 2.7 ? => Warning: GenericErrorHandler 2: chmod(): Operation
not permitted on line 861 of file
/srv/www/[mysite.co.uk/public](http://mysite.co.uk/public)_html/symphony/lib/toolkit/class.general.php

I know this is related to permission, but here given path "/srv/www/" is not
the site path. I'm not sure where it's coming from. May be a cache issue ?

@cyberlee1 I’d say, it’s somewhere in the middle of a triangle of the two and
some possible other CMS/Framework.

It is a CMS by definition, but it does not make any assumptions about you site
and data structure.

Not sure if the others here agree `:)`
