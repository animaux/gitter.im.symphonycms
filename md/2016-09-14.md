Hi all, from what I understand all routes point here for Symphony help. I'm a
Gitter newbie. How is Gitter, which on the face of it looks like a single chat
stream, better than a forum organised by topic and searchable in Google? I've
tried a search in Gitter but it reveals out-of-context messages highlighting
the search string. Is the intention to use Gitter in combination with help on
Github Issues?

Okay, I can search the archives in Google, but still...

@cylkee  
Symphony has a forum: <http://www.getsymphony.com/discuss/>  
but you can ask for a specific question in chatroom:  
<https://gitter.im/symphonycms/symphony-2/help>  
for faster response, I guess.
