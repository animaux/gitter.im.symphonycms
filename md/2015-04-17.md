@michael-e Symphony doesn’t do anything specific to santise data when saved
into the DB. It’s the responsibility of the fields to ensure they are saving
and sanitising data that they can later read

Looking at the Search Index DS, Nick already has a function that fixes
encoding, <https://github.com/symphonists/search_index/blob/master/data-
sources/data.search.php#L44-L51>

The editor redactor got also a function to prevent the nbsp I think
<https://github.com/remie/richtext_redactor/blob/master/text-
formatters/formatter.redactor.php#L15-L19> Is the problem in that function?

@brendo I saw Nick's function but it didn't change @moretaste's nbsp when
building excerpt data from entry text? Does it need an extra bit to strip
those html chars?
