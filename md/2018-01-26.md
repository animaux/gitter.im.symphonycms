As of MySQL 5.7.4, NO_ZERO_DATE is deprecated. In MySQL 5.7.4 through 5.7.7,
NO_ZERO_DATE does nothing when named explicitly. Instead, its effect is
included in the effects of strict SQL mode. In MySQL 5.7.8 and later,
NO_ZERO_DATE does have an effect when named explicitly and is not part of
strict mode, as before MySQL 5.7.4. However, it should be used in conjunction
with strict mode and is enabled by default. A warning occurs if NO_ZERO_DATE
is enabled without also enabling strict mode or vice versa. For additional
discussion, see SQL Mode Changes in MySQL 5.7.

____

looks like it that PESKY strict mode again

____

and it 's the 2.3.1 migration that causes the problem (released when there was
no mysql 5.6 nor 5.7)

____

can you try to disable strict mode just for the update ?

____

if not, try to fix the 2.3.1 migration code to include a default date
