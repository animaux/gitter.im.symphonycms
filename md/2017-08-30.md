@nitriques @pixelninja I have replaced the class.entrymanager.php with the new
one, now the optional empty field bug is gone, but when i try to empty an
image field, it doesn't work 100%: in the backend I click on remove image: The
file uploaded is no longer available. Please check that it exists, and is
readable. On the frontend, I post an empty fields[image] nothing happens.
Anyone else has this? I have checked it on multiple sites running 2.7.0.

Is there an easy way to show in the symphony backend the custom code for a
custom event in stead of the documentation?

do you have a page parameter called `member-id` ?

____

if yes that’s also the variable of the default logged in member. so I suggest
you change your page parameter name not to conflict. If someone is logged in
`member-id` will always be set

Yes it's attached to a page and I have a page parameter called member-id. When
I pass a member ID other than mine(logged in user) it filter the DS correctly,
but when I don't pass a member ID it returns logged in user.

@nitriques & @alexnantel88 at least for cases where the database is located in
the same server as your config file is. Though I guess if there’s client
sensitive data it might also be an extra layer of protection for backup
storing and stuff.

____

personal information I guess phone numbers and addresses is as far as I’ve got
right now. and for some clients we do have client data including addresses
etc. but given those need to be searchable I don’t think the field is the
right approach.

@nitriques sorry been AFK for a while - I mean use cases to use encrypted
fields. As most times if your server is compromised so would your encryption
keys.
