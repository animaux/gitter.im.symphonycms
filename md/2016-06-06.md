guys; any idea how to best proceed when you want to pull up the saved ‘entry’
from an event post?

I’m thinking something like the `$etm-entry-id`where the saved entry id is
output as a parameter that can be used by datasources. Don’t think that we
have that right now correct?

The delegates passing the entry object do not help in your case?
(`EventPostSaveFilter`, `EventFinalSaveFilter`)

they could; what I would like is to save an entry; then return the entry
including the non-post data. as I need to return them via json. the filters
would work as it would allow adding the parameter to the page. but I wonder if
it would make sense to have it built in kind of for chaining ability etc

Hmmm, in this case the simplest way would be to include the entry ID in a
redirect that goes to an API page. I don't know what you mean by "chaining",
however.

    if($result->getAttribute('id')) {
        Frontend::instance()->Page()->_param['ev-save-contact'] = $result->getAttribute('id');
    }

____

that does the trick within the event (but not quite sure it’s really clean) at
least hacking the event every time is not

____

it’s like with ETM when you create an entry you have access to the id to link
to a datasource. I think it makes sense to have the same thing for the
standard symphony flow.

This should work as well:

____

    
    
     $params = Frontend::instance()->Page()->Params();
    $params['ev-save-contact'] = $result->getAttribute('id');

____

It looks less hacky, but is essentially the same thing.

ah I guess, I wonder if something like that would make sense to bake into the
core. //cc @nitriques

Might be nice, yes. But I haven't thought about possible implications. :-)

Could be possible to to for Section Events ... but I do not know how to make
it general to all events

____

I have events that only does redirects... they would not need this

good point - I think section events sounds fine.

____

when the redirect option is not set (as otherwise it’s pointless) are there
any other events one can generate via the interface which might need this? I
think by default you can only have section-events (much like the section
datasources)

Generated from the backend: yes only section events are supported right now
