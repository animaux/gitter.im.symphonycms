hmm

____

I’m having an ‘issue’ with loading too many documents… maybe because I’m on my
local server… but got around 33500 entries to index. (excluding images etc
etc) and getting that indexed is taking me hours…. with the current ajax
pagination

the problem it paginates via Ajax, 10 at a time and each ‘ajax page’ is taking
approx 13-15seconds… presumably because of lag

I’ll probably halt it and continue it on a remote server. maybe it will be at
least a bit quicker

> Always use the bulk api, which indexes multiple documents in one request,
and experiment with the right number of documents to send with each bulk
request. The optimal size depends on many factors, but try to err in the
direction of too few rather than too many documents. Use concurrent bulk
requests with client-side threads or separate asynchronous requests.

____

it seems the extension does none of that… single updates per entry. I guess
it’s due an update on that front.

is in case it will ever need re-indexing.

though the server is much larger than my local machine… it’s around 2-4s vs
13s… so the rest should go on faster.

Still it sounds a bit slow to me. Running a PHP script from the Command Line,
I can index around 12 to 14 entries per second without using bulk indexing or
similar. Of course it depends on the size and number of fields. (My benchmark
is for a medium complicated "news" section.) How complicated is your mapping?

Yep, I do, but I also don't use any public extension. I once invested money
and work for an unreleased (i.e. private) extension – which I have even pimped
for Elasticsearch 2.x the other day – and some PHP scripts to be run from the
Command Line.

ahh I’m using the public one will be happy to optimize it (pretty sure client
wants that anyway)

____

when I say it takes around 2 seconds now I think it’s actually indexing around
10 or 20 entries in one go

so performance wise might be in-line with yours I guess

10 per second is pretty good, I think. You will make it in less than one hour.

yes I would think so (except I forgot to set the tab not to go sleep…) so re-
started the process. I’ll try to move it to non-ajax though as I think it
would be much faster.

I found that the indexing (no matter if scripted mass indexing or asynchronous
or synchronous indexing in Symphony) is the most complicated stuff when using
Elasticsearch. Second hardest is building the desired queries automatically
(when using advanced stuff like aggregations).

for aggregations and filters but I haven’t got to indexing everything I need
to try out a lot of the filtering functionality required

I could maybe help with parts of my CLI script (the parts that don't rely on
the actual mapping/indexing functionality of the private extension). It might
at least give you an idea. If you are interested, drop me an email or a
private Github message. (I don't know how the latter works, however.)

sure thanks for the help actually :) mapping shouldn’t be a problem I just
need to get a proof of concept to the client so then they can decide weather
they will move forward with replacing Google Custom Search but it’s very
likely at this point.

websites, one Symphony installation). Meanwhile I want to upgrade the server

the worst I had was a 2.0 beta….. last year ended up doing a rebuild which I
think was easier in the end.

Now I have a 2.3.x I believe with SSM I think I might try push for an update
in the coming months. as it’s a bit too far behind.

Other small sites usually don’t get the budget but I should try to incorporate
it going forward to reduce security risks for the server as a whole
