@wdebusschere I did not understand ... does this mean that I can not use the
variables? $ Workspace, $ root?

@josealbertorodriguesjunior No variables in your css if it is just a static
file. You could generate it though.

Iâ€™d rather not use a CSS file to reference to an often changing image file.
Inline-CSS would be totally fine for that.

OK thank you! I will test with inline css same, if it does not work out, the
way it will be to stylize the image class itself
