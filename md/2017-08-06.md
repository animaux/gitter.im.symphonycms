Hey there! I'm having troubles with markdown editor extensions... What's
happen is that when i select a word and mark as bold, in my XML that word is
surounded by <strong>, but it does not work in my front end

____

I installed the preview text area extension, and in the preview the bold also
worked ... Do you have any idea what it can be?

____

The extensions that i 'm using is markdown text edito and markdown editor
