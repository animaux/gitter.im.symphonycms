@zlatkovtv CMS is for contents publishing with standard structures for what
you see is what you get. If you need responsive, performance and Javascript
(Node.js) for universal framework rather than locked down to one langauge. I
would say in 2017, you can do:

  * Swift language for sever side, backend APIs and iOS mobile
  * Node.js for dynamic or sever sider render contents like Sveltejs (<https://svelte.technology>) Rich Harris developed Rollup.js and part of Guardian Interactive team where you probably seen the US Election 2016 ([https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/nov/08/us-election-2016-results-live-clinton-trump?view=map&type=presidential)](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/nov/08/us-election-2016-results-live-clinton-trump?view=map&type=presidential\))

Using both together, it 's perfect combination! It took me years to find both
that exactly meets all my requirements.
