I'm also going to create a divider extension. SImilar to the publish tabs
extension, but it injects a heading into the page between fields instead of
splitting them up.

Another extension I've whipped up: <https://github.com/pixelninja/field_group>

____

Has 2 fields, Group Start and Group End. Any field within those 2 fields are
grouped into a wrapper and display in a row instead of stacked.
