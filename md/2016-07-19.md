Any idea why my Remote Datasource always says "Cache has expired or does not
exist." ?

____

Do I need to have an extension installed to support or something?

No it should cache in database. did you set a ‘time / expiry’ ?

cache expiration = 31557600

does it still cache if I have a {$param} in the url?

it doesn't change much, it is just {$http-host} so that the datasource works
on my dev and staging server

____

like this <http://{$http-host}/en-us/api/catalog?xml=1> in the url

that should be fine for caching

____

within the datasource - you should have an option for ‘how long in minutes’
you want to cache

____

haven’t got a remote datasource set up right now but it might be that (unless
the xml output doesn’t show if it’s cached or not) but it definitely should
store/read stuff from the database cache

it would show if you use ?profile (and have profile devkit installed) as if
you get from a remote source the datasource load time would be high, if cached
would be quite low. some 0.01s

If anyone want’s to try my far from finished backend style refresh. Backup
your `symphony.min.css` and temporarily replace with this:
<https://github.com/animaux/symphony-2/blob/2.7.x/symphony/assets/css/symphony.min.css>
Just interested if people think it might be a way to go with `2.7.x`?

____

Just make-up. Not as dramatic as  @johnpuddephatt design.

____

Might bork things on `2.6.x` but maybe not.

whole linked data source instead of just id and text fields?

Either use a separate DS to fetch linked entries by `@id` or use the AI-Suite
instead of `select_box`—>

@jonmifsud I just read in the `association_ui_editor`s readme that it »works
with core select boxes and tag lists as well as with Association fields.«. Is
that true for the Selector/Output as well?

@animaux Output for sure not - there is a special delegate. Selector I might
work, but have not really tried it.

____

the logic would be the same but maybe the preferences are not usually
available via the standard sbl interface.

____

@reygoch I would really not _recommend_ people to learn using
association_output :)

even though it’s quite convenient

@animaux yep I'm aware of those extensions – the problem is they all add a
stylesheet whereas I'm wanting to replace the default stylesheet. I could just
replace symphony.min.css but I think it makes more sense to package it as an
extension, which is what I've done.

If association stuff is just a UI (as the name suggests), it will be
"decoupled" anyway if we have an XSLT frontend. But I am afraid that it has
its own database stuff, maybe…

____

As you know my  "big system" uses frontend-publishing exclusively. I had no
need to use anything but SBL fields. (Certain stuff is simply unusable in the
backend, but I don't care.)

Answering my own question: I am afraid that "association" is more than just a
UI. It's several extensions.

I'm just using association output, and regular select boxes. This is just to
demonstrate some more complex relations that can be achieved.

> But I am afraid that it has its own database stuff, maybe…

It’s all in the core though + what used to be in SBL there is no ‘real’ change
from SBL to Association in terms of data other than the UI (through 3
extensions)

Also, I would have to pair entries from 2 different datasurces in XSLT, so I
think this is the way to go for what I want to achieve.
