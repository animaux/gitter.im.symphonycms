@Vandenberg just checked the files I can’t quite work with that… not on
windows. all I needed was the webroot (which is there) and a mysql data dump.
as regards the checkbox it looks good to me.

they set up the same thing but the json is seperated into files

I 'm trying to emulate that with symphony output

____

have a couple of events missing (I think I can work anyway just want to

I have added an event to try and set the 'done' checkbox to true when the
event is called from the front end

____

it 's a pain because the partials are static htmls (with angular) that are not
generated with xslt

____

want to see if I can make those dynamic as well

____

so the problem again is that I don 't understand how to use these dynamically
generated 'pages' as references for angular

so you have the angular server running?

____

when you look at \root\angular-todo\app

____

in \js there is an angular app set up in different files

____

in services.js it makes a http request for the json data

____

I have made a page/utility that created json output from the entries in
section Todo

____

on the home page the app gets initiated and read s the json from the page
localhost:8080/json/todos

____

(  'todos' is added by an angular variable)

____

when an item is clicked in the front-end, the angular app tries to load the
json situated at localhost:8080/json/{varName}
