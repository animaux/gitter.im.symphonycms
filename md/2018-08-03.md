@Jerrok , can you be more specific?

All, how are you guys using XML Importer? I used to use it to import external
files but now it looks like Remote Datasource is used for that purpose. I 'm
trying to understand the use cases for using XML Importer 3.0 since I use
Associations and it seem kind of similar?
