@tiloschroeder Sure »du« is not impolite. But I always feel a »Du« makes it
feel warmer and might even make a machines message a bit more human.

@nitriques have to find out what amp is before I can join the applause `:D`.
What about `2.7.1` btw? *cough* I just hat to fix another installation and had
to remember to install the latest `2.7.x` like you said. Would be nice to have
that out as a release.

Is there any documentation/example around on what is needed for a field
extension to make it’s internal fields fillable via frontend-forms? I guess I
have to look at existing code …

In case anyone is interested. You can submit frontend data to the
`maplocationfield` via frontend forms. But i does choke on latlngs with
integer values (e.g. `50.1345, 10`).

@animaux you know, the only thing that drives my open source contributions are
1) business 2) fun. I know lots of people are waiting on the 2.7.1 release,
but I'll only do it when either situation 1 or 2 can be achieved. Right now 1
are extensions and 2 is Symphony 3 :sparkles:

____

That being said, If any of you want to help, the best thing is to checkout the
opened pr, test, and confirm that the bug is fixed.

____

@animaux that maplocationfield bug could easily be fixed ;)

Thanks Nicolas, and sorry to bother. I confirm! Using the fix on several sites
with success.

____

Couldn’t quite pinpoint the bug exactly in `maplocationfield`. But in the wild
a coordinate without `.` is unlikely to turn up. But then again my hometown
sits on `lng=10` …

____

Nick Dunn’s extensions are quite hard to understand for me as a not-
really-a-programmer.

@animaux I am 99% confident that the bug is in the field's
processRawFieldData.. I would try to printf the values with a fixed number of
decimals

____

the DB is expecting a double
