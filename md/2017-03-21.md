@nitriques thanks for merging the PHP7-extension-fixes. Itâ€™s possible there
are incompatibilities left since I havenâ€™t tested all the functions. But they
should generally run.

Iâ€™m trying to figure out this problem here: symphonists/documenter#25

    
    
        $drawer = Widget::Drawer(
          'documenter',
          ($button != '' ? $button : __('Documentation')),
          $docs,
          'closed'
        );

Is the button-part automaticly adding classes to the button?

    
    
    <a href="#drawer-documenter" class="button drawer vertical-right">Hilfe?</a>

The resulting classes clash with Symphony 2.7.x CSS resulting in the layout
problem shown in the issue. However, it the classes are generated
automatically the fix for this would need to be in the Symphony CSS rather
than the extension? Can anyone follow me? `:)`

Fix would have to be in the Symphony CMS in order to prevent a dirty hack in
the exntesion CSS.

Itâ€™s like constantly installing updates and updates â€¦

I was just going to suggest a really good manual. But it seems itâ€™s not been
translated into french or english `:(`. Itâ€™s called Â»BabyjahreÂ« by Remo H.
Largo, a swiss guy.

Bummer. But we are lucky to have both grandmas near by and available, this
helps a lot

Itâ€™s about the psychology of toddlers and small infants and it helped me a lot
in understanding most of their actions and needs.

Itâ€™s said it was translated into several other languages, but I was not able
to find it. Nevermind. `</offtopic>`
