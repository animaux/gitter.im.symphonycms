@michael-e are you around? A clients ENM is crashing …

____

`Symphony Fatal Error: syntax error, unexpected '=', expecting '{'`

____

`class recipientgroupVerteiler_kollwitz_=_stufa_dd_fk_dd_frauen_asyl_dd
extends RecipientSourceStatic`

____

Is that about the `=` inside the class name?

____

There is no such character in the recipient group name. Though my client might
have deletec it already.

Yes, I am pretty sure that you must not have `=` in a class name. I have no
idea where it comes from. But you might test if it is possible to save this,
and open an issue.

Thanks Michael. I was in contact with the client just now. They had the `=`in
the name and removed it afterwards. Apparently that does not change the class
name. The recipient group could be deleted, but there is no way to do this in
the backend. So how do I delete a group? `:)`

@michael-e is it enough to simply delete the corresponding `recipient_group.*`
file?

Hm, I might have hacked around the extension when building the site. I just
can’t remember exactly why.

____

For some reason I needed to limit the number of recipient groups.

But why?

Don't ask me. :-) I will have to close the GitHub issue if I can't be sure
that it happens with a current, unhacked version of ENM.

Yes, that’s probably sensible. However the only hacks I did seems to be
translations.

Just one last thing that doesn’t really fit in the github-issue. Do you need
to be admin to create recipient-lists?

creating a new newsletter?

What do you mean by "create a newsletter"? Create an entry in a section that
has an ENM field?

The field will show all recipient groups which have been selected for this
field (in the section editor). So if you add new recipient groups, you must
edit the section's ENM field.

That was why I limited the number of recipient groups so it’s always the same
ones and the field does not need to be updated.

If you want the user to edit groups but not create new ones, it might suffice
to remove the "Create New" button in the backend using JavaScript. No
extension hacking required.
