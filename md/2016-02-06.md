We have a rather annoying bug in Sym 2.6.6: symphonycms/symphony-2#2557

__ __

As a quick fix, you can replace `General::intval` with `intval` in line 13 of
`symphony/content/content.ajaxquery.php`

Hey @/all \- have any of y'all ever used lunr.js with Symphony? If so, could
you point to an example on how you used it with your XSLT?

@bzerangue lunr.js seems to be 100% client based.. So i do not thibk it has to
do with xslt (which is server side)
