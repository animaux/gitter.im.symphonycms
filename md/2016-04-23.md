@jonmifsud nice! You did not need any extra delegates?

Not really I think just one to any association based field for filtering

____

Not to the core though, it uses a filtering delegate

Hey all, does anyone have any experience of integrating Facebook signin with
the Members Extension?

@jean-luc I’ve been asked that question a day or two ago; so far it’s
something I’ve not done personally. I had a separate oAuth extension which
handled oAuth logins but I had not merged that with the Members Extension per-
se.

____

have you tried anything with Facebook login yet or you’re just with a standard
Members extension at this point?

My guess is that you would have to extend/provide a new membership class.

____

Which would run the alternative authentication; and mark the user as signed
in. It’s somewhere on my list of items to tackle
