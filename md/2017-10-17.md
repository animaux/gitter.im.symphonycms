yeah it’s a bit creepy right now. she had made quite a few enemies. I think
mostly political but others are saying she had implicated the Italian mafia
etc… hopefully the investigation is taken seriously

@nitriques: Meanwhile I understand the Members Password Update issue
discovered by @tiloschroeder. I will open an issue on GitHub and send a PR
when I find the time. (The description might get a bit lengthy.)

I have transferred the Import/Export CSV extension to the Symphonists account
on GitHub: <https://github.com/symphonists/importcsv> I released version 1.0
which should work fine with Symphony 2.6. It should be a good start for the
community's effort to have one central version of this extension instead of
many distributed ones.
