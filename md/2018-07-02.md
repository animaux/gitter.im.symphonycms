Is there a way to make a regular DS output all fields, no matter if they are
filled or empty?

@nitriques I will be upgrading from 2.5.2 to 2.7.7 and see a lot of
compatibility is set to "unsure" on extensions. Do you think I'll likely run
into issues? Site is fairly simple (www.shrimp.dj) - main extensions: JIT
manipulations, Order Entries, Subsection Manager, Union Datasource, Unique
Upload Field, XML Importer. I'm afraid my PHP skills are pretty terrible so
troubleshooting will be hard for me. Thank you, sir!

`Subsection Manager` will need to be replaced. Most other extensions should
have updated versions that run under 5.6, some need little tweaks to run under
7.2.

Not sure about Union DS.

There’s a guide on how to move from SSM to Association field. It’s linked
somewhere up in this thread.

As for point `2.` here is more info on that:

field-expressions>

(keep in mind to use `//entry` not `entry` in reflection_field 2.0)

I thought SSM only ran until `2.3.x`

You’re welcome. And you will need the `association output` extension. And will
need to add associated entry fields later on in your datasources. Sometimes
the templates will need little adjustments too then.
