I have a local copy of a site with frontend users. I have logged out the
frontend user and now I am not able to log into the backend with my admin
account anymor? How could this happen? Is there a way to reset the admin PW on
a local installation? Sendmail is not working either …

If you know your way around the database you can manually update a password

Use an md5 hash

Thanks Jon, I have just managed to get in with another workaround :)

I logged in as another user I had the credentials of. Then changed that user
in the SQL to admin. Deleted the non-working via SQL. Recreated it via second
user. Reset old user to author.

____

Feels a bit like a security hole though. And I wonder how the original login
got borked.

A few times I experienced a broken cookie/session. Have you tried to delete
the browser's cookie first in order to get a new session?

Nope. Now it’s too late to try, but good to know in the future :) thanks!

____

I discovered a file system problem on the server too. Could’ve been that as
well.
