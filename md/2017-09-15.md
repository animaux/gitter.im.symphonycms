Hi All, Quick question. Re. Association Field, Can I have associated fields as
child elements rather having them as xml element properties ?

Hi. I'm having a problem in a data source. When I visit a particular DS I got
this error => array_map(): Argument #2 should be an array
/symphony/content/content.blueprintsdatasources.php around line 119  
This should be something related to the correspoding Section. Any Ideas?.
Thanks.

@nitriques I like the look of the sendgrid extension. Will give it a whirl.

Has anyone integrated Stripe payments with Symphony? I have a project which
may require an integration. I was thinking of basing a new extension on the
old Paypal extension, but I 'm not sure if any of you have done anything
already?

their js lib. But please share your creation !!!

@nimanthaharshana associates entries should reside in their <item> element, no
?
