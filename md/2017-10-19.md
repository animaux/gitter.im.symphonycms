@andrewminton yes, we cracked it. The missing link was to disable xsrf in
config.php. I see now that there is a symphonists fork
<http://symphonyextensions.com/extensions/importcsv/> in which this might have
been addressed. We'll be looking at this in the next couple of days as well as
updating for PHP7.

Hi all, I have ran into an issue with the latest version of Symphony 2.7 and
was wondering if anyone knows how to fix it, whenever I upload a file via a
image upload field or the file upload field in the backend of a entry, when I
remove the file via the 'remove file' button then save changes, the file gets
deleted but doesn't update the entry properly and has a constant error of 'The
file uploaded is no longer available. Please check that it exists and is
readable.'

@Huttch yes, its a bug, 2.7.1 will have this fixed, meanwhile you can check on
github and change the code
