I've got ultra newbie question up here: how in section's entity (using
Textarea, Multilanguage Text Box, etc.) could I reference to variables like
$this-year? I mean, how my copywriter who is writing articles could print data
stored in Data Source?

Ah good question. The easiest way to do that would be using what’s called the
XSLT ninja technique.

not that much :) - simplest way for you would be to create html tags which are
to be replaced

for example you can ask him to input &lt;this-year/&gt; in the text where you
want this year variable to appear

which means when you output text you are using `<xsl:apply-template select
=‘your-text’ mode=‘html/>`

__ __

now the trick with the XSLT would be the following. you will need to match the
new “tag” you created for your variable and replace it with the values you
want

__ __

Example

    
    
    <xsl:template match="this-year" mode="html">
        <xsl:value-of select="/data/params/this-year">
    </xsl:template>

if you need further clarification just let me know.

Am I missing something? I've replaced `<xsl:copy-of>` with `<xsl:apply-
templates>` for **Ninja Technique** but `<xsl:apply-templates
select="/data/products/entry[./title/@handle = $arg1]/longdescription"/>`
gives me raw output (just text)

@jonmifsud: As Ninja Technique seems really powerfull and fits nearly all of
my requirements, I still can't manage how to deal with `<a href="<root
/>/path-to-image.png">Image</a>` in XML. I know its dissallowed due to parsing
processor limits but in xsl its just `<a href="{$root}/path-to-
image.png">Image</a>`. I believe there exists a clean and robust solution :)

You don't need the root in your custom tag, you can add it in XSLT using an
overriding template for your tag, like `<xsl:template match="img[starts-
with(@src, '/')]" mode="html">...</xsl:template>`

Tell us how it goes. Most of us really love the Ninja technique. It is, btw, a
combination of "Identity Transformation" and "Template Overrides". And if you
ever want to buy a single book on XSLT, I can tell you which one.

yeah ninja technique has a lot of uses. Sorry for the delayed reply was AFK.
for links I tend to use a slight variation - note it’s not related to your
problem exactly what Micheal said should fit the bill perfectly

    
    
    <xsl:template match="@link" mode="html">
        <xsl:attribute name="href">
            <xsl:apply-templates select="/data/datasource-pages/entry[title/@handle=current()]" mode="page-link"/>
        </xsl:attribute>
    </xsl:template>

Where I would have a datasource which is used to generate links to
articles/pages generated by Symphony. I tend to use a mixture of names / id’s
depending on the project. Note I use attribute link instead of href to make it
easier to spot the difference and your copywriter can simply add a link using
the page name not having to worry about the domain etc.

__ __

Note I would have a separate template generate the links, usually I have one
per Symphony section where applicable.

I just re-read my comment above, and it might be mistaken. With "buying a
single book" I didn't want to say "buy more books". I meant "the one, the
must-have book".

@michael-e which book would that be?Wondering if I should keep one around just
in case. Online sources are pretty scattered.

I mentioned it sometimes in the forum, it's "XSLT 1.0 Pocket Reference" by
Evan Lenz. I bought the ebook (PDF), and when reading it, XSLT became much
clearer to me. Especially the chapter "How XSLT Works" was an eye-opener.

For the price looks like a bargain. Even one tip or two would make it up.
Planning to introduce someone to XSLT over the summer it would be quite good
for reference. thanks!
