Guys. I’m getting a `Fatal error: Call to a member function getContext() on
null in /…/symphony/lib/toolkit/class.field.php on line 739` on a live site
after an update from 2.6.2 to 2.6.7 with no further details. Any ideas where
to look? Could be the inclusion of a possibly still not fully encrypted_input
field too.

__ __

The error is on event execution. Will try to resave the event.

__ __

Ok, that didn’t help.

so frontend when the event is saved?

does the ‘thing’ you’re saving use thenew encryption field?

Nope, but it does use a section that is including it.

__ __

Jep, it’s an entry creation and e-mail notification event.

__ __

Via ETM

Is there a way to get more verbose error messages?

not sure; what I would usually do is go to the line where you have the error

and do a var dump on that line… or try understand what ‘is’ null it’s probably
something trivial

Hmn, strangely no problem on a local server.

__ __

Might be some `PHP 5.6`-incompatibiliy in some extension?

Switching to `PHP 5.5` doesn’t help.

If the problem is field-related it should be either `association`, `date` or a
`checkbox`.

It **IS** the `association field`. Apparently there was some change from
`1.0.0beta` to `1.0.1` that results in this error being thrown.

Jup. There was some partial sync-confusion. In the end the error was the same
both locally and online. And the remedy, to switch back to `1.0.0beta` worked
for both too.

that would be odd; I use this version &gt;
<https://github.com/mazedigital/association_field/tree/association_filters>
exclusively It shouldn’t have any major difference to 1.0.1 and I don’t recall
any frontend errors.

also are you trying to save by ‘id’ or maybe using the actual ‘value’ ?

Hmm. This strange header-error with the huge dump persists, whether I use your

unlikely; that error seems to be saying that somewhere in that line it’s

I’ll check maybe I was using it with a non-updated Symphony version and there
was some change on how that context stuff works; which is throwing the error.

The context-related functions in the field.php have shuffled around a bit
between these version.

Ok, you’re more likely to be right about this than my gut feeling.
