Guys. I’m getting a `Fatal error: Call to a member function getContext() on
null in /…/symphony/lib/toolkit/class.field.php on line 739` on a live site
after an update from 2.6.2 to 2.6.7 with no further details. Any ideas where
to look? Could be the inclusion of a possibly still not fully encrypted_input
field too.

____

The error is on event execution. Will try to resave the event.

____

Ok, that didn’t help.

`1.0.0beta` to `1.0.1` that results in this error being thrown.

Jup. There was some partial sync-confusion. In the end the error was the same
both locally and online. And the remedy, to switch back to `1.0.0beta` worked
for both too.

also are you trying to save by ‘id’ or maybe using the actual ‘value’ ?

was some change on how that context stuff works; which is throwing the error.
