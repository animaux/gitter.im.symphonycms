@wdebusschere @nitriques Aha, might that be related to why
<https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/blob/master/symphony/lib/toolkit
/data-sources/datasource.section.php> is missing? I couldn't work out why
these datasources were all returning empty results, but it's because none of
them were actually being run! I'm having trouble finding documentation
regarding what to do instead of including `datasource.section.php` as used to
be done in `v2.3`.

Out of interest I just scanned the basic Symphony repo folder and was
surprised to find the single most extreme data-hog to be the HTML-Purifier …

HTML purifier? That’s used for what? I don’t think it it’s the markdown
extensions as those are separated

It is the Markdown extension. I always wanted this to be removed.

It's there to reduce security risks (like XSS), I think. But I never use it.
My XSLT templates would never let "dangerous" HTML elements pass through
anyway.

____

And I would prefer a small Markdown extension, doing Mardown only.

ah right - yeah I think it’s the last option in the markdown list/dropdown.
Same here - I think I use the “Smarty Pants” option because it makes sense for
the industry I provide it to. but otherwise the plain old markdown is great

I’ve only used the purifier on one site where really shitty html is imported
via an XML `:Ü`.

____

Another hog is `selectize.js` which is not used anymore anywhere and should go
in `3.0.0`

What are some of the possible reasons for the reflection field not working? I
have two fields Name (handle - name) and Surname (handle - surname) and a
reflection field Full Name (handle - full-name) set to `{entry/name}
{entry/surname}` , but just the blank space is appearing.

I’m not sure if the changes introduces in v2 apply to the non-utility syntax
as well. The docs don’t mention that.

Will have a look if I have that running somewhere …

I did a quick test and it works as it should. Of cource the xpath should match
your handles, not the long form.

`{entry/vorname} {entry/nachname}`

I will ask @nitriques if this might break the default usage.

____

he has removed the `//` which could mean `//entry/handle` was working.

____

You could try using them in the expression in `2.0.2`, so `{entry/name}` would
be `{//entry/name}`.

If you specify the path from `/data`, I think you also need to specify the
name of the `reflection-field-handle` before `entry` as per the
[readme](https://github.com/symphonists/reflectionfield).
