Is there any plugin / extension available in Getsymphony CSS for caching ?

@Ankur1626Ankur_twitter there's a guide to caching in Symphony here â€“ it's a
little old but I think it's still a solid overview
<http://www.getsymphony.com/learn/articles/view/a-guide-to-caching-
extensions/>  
Both extensions referred to (cachelite and cacheable data source) are
maintained and compatible with the latest release.
