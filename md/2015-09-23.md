FYI somewhat urgent bug one of my clients came across. They deleted the
entries in a section - we can create/edit entries but list view not working
any pointers?

There’s a custom extension/field but it’s not in the table view- though
symphony recognises the fact that there are 3 entries

hah issue was related to datetime field - when null and using sorting on that
field… guess the new entries were set with a null value.
