            <h3>Page: <xsl:value-of select="data/categories-and-coords/entry/page"/></h3>
        </div>
    </xsl:template>

I don't see the difference between these two, but my website does. What is
wrong in the first option?

XSLT tries to match / by default so if you just have the top template it might
be making everything garbled up

__ __

    
    
    <xsl:template match="/“>
        <xsl:apply-templates select='/data/categories-and-coords/entry’/>
    </xsl:template>

I would replace the 2nd template with the above and have both together

It didn't help at all, just gave a different output, still wrong one

__ __

I don't understand why the second code I pasted works, but the first one which
looks same doesn't

__ __

I don't want to have both templates at once, I want only one

__ __

but it keeps giving me all the data from params altogether with the correct
information

I read it wrong, it works. But why does it work like that?

because XSLT’s base rule is to match root or `/`

__ __

In that template you can call / use other templates as needed to create the
expected results
