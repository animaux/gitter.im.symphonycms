hi, i am trying to customize an event to create a new entry and update an
existing one if a key value of an entry exists. I understood how to get a
field value using the entryManager inside the load function. But it requires
an entry ID. Is there a way to fetch an entry using a field value instead of
an ID?

a kind of $EntryManager->fetchByField($section_id, $field_id, $field_value);

Is your field value unique? If so you’re going to have to build a manual query
to get that ID

____

at least I’m not aware of the EntryManager supporting a fetch by Field Value

    Symphony::Database()->fetchVar(“entry_id",0,“SELECT entry_id FROM sym_entries_data_x SELECT entry_id WHERE value = ‘yourvalue' “); 

where x = your field id

____

if the return is null

____

then you have to create a new entry

I mean, the idea of the event is to update if already created

____

hoo ok

____

sorry

____

thought it was the entry id not the field id

I found it in the sym_fields table, thanks for the explanation

____

In fact I should change the logic: event create the entry, result an error if
the required unique field already exists

____

find the id of the entry with the existing unique field value, and update

____

no?

if you have the unique logic it might work; it depends on what is the most
common + a read operation is usually less `expensive` than a write operation

____

so I usually check first then decide

users. Testing now
