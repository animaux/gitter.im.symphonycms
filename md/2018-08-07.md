I have seen the light - XML Importer 3.0 is great : ]

Do any of you know of any way to automatically sort entries added into an
association field? For instance, I add photos to an Association field for
photo albums, but they are never ordered by filename and I have to manually
drag them around to get them in order. Is there a systematic way to get the
photos to order by filename? I figure it's a long shot but thought I'd ask.

Thanks @wdebusschere. I figured I may need to do it using xsl:sort outside of
a section entry. But didn't know if there was a nifty trick where I could do a
sort inside the Association field. I appreciate you commenting!

Hey guys, it's possible get values from symphony backend fields (Like a text
input or checkbox)? I want to get values from input fields and use it on a PHP
script using Backend Action extension
