@jonmifsud, would you help me testing? I thought about the following, what do
you think?

____

    
    
     foreach ($atts as $att) {
        $att = $this->evalXPath($att, false);
        if (filter_var($att, FILTER_VALIDATE_URL)) {
            $atts_eval[] = $att;
        } else {
            $atts_eval[] = DOCROOT . $att;
        }

Yes, and evaluating the XPath first, so the `{` and `}` are gone from the URL
(although `filter_var` currently thinks it's valid).

Anyway this would require some documentation. People shouldn 't use HTTP when
sending mass emails (with the ENM), at least not if every recipient gets the
same attachment. Saving the file locally first would be much more efficient
then.

re ENM I might be sending a few PR’s when I have some time. I’d like to add
support to some other email gateway(s).. but I’m not sure how to proceed yet.

good point! I’ll need to read through the API’s a bit more in depth and
familarise myself with the code. Basically had something working with
Mandrill, which needs a shift to another povider (And they do not
support/recommend sending bulk emails one by one) but I need to clarify how I
think it should hook up before I can discuss it… anyway get some rest!

BTW, as far as I remember, additional Email Gateways can be added by
extensions. So probably there would be no need to change the ENM.

ENM has hardcoded 3 gateways… at the moment, SES, SMTP and Sendmail. mainly it
seems like it’s used to pass custom options.. but probably there’s another way
around it which wouldn’t require hardcoding each one in ENM

@jonmifsud: Now I see what you mean. It's kind of: Gateways are either
Symphony's own gateways or they are added by extensions. The ENM, however,
must be prepared for gateways which have special config options (because it
uses a gateway definition per Newsletter).

The problem is probably due to a custom event. The custom event submit the
submitter . If the status of that submit is succes it submits the collegeaus.  
I filter now with `etm-post-email` (the e-mail address of the submitter). When
I submit a second time with the same e-mail address I've got the collegeaus of
the first submit.

____

I think the collegeaus data isn 't yet available at the moment the etm send
the e-mail.

No, because the first (the submitter) is required and colleagues are optional

right now I don’t have time to wrap my head around it… but you might be able
to use the ‘post values’ in the XSLT if you really need them

possible but you miss all the basic validation of the fields that way

if that’s an issue… then your logic is completely wrong as it is

____

if you need to check everything before saving… it doesn’t make sense to save
one and then the rest

____

you might want to try saving multiple items in one go… if they are in the same
section

I don't get it. The custom event is to check if the values of the first
section are ok and succesfull submitted otherwise there can't be colleagues.
The colleagues can be multiple but will also validate. I can't see what is
wrong with that.

If you need valid colleagues before you can use the ‘post’ data it means you
are saving the main entry before confirming the colleagues are successful. and
the email is going out at that point

____

you need to validate everything before sending the first one from my
understanding.

That is exactly what I like to achieve. But thought that I could do that bij
chaining two events and make use of the core functions.

So the only possibility is a complete custom event that validates, trigger the
second event, validates that and on succes submit first the colleagues and
than the submitter including sending the e-mail?
