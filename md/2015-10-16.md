@michael-e Using ENM - i’m having an issue with chaining and the recipient
list. Should I be able to chain the newsletter id and other datasources to get
a ‘sublist’ ?

@michael-e seems that the filters are ‘executed’ before the process filters -
I think it’s usually done somewhere in the construct or maybe before?
Temporary solution I had to duplicate the params array, and replace the ds
filters when the processParams function is called.

What you can do is chain Data Sources, as usual, with one difference:
dependencies must be added manually. It's in the README!

@michael-e I did add the dependencies

____

but if I checked what DSParamFilters contained, my ‘variable’ was missing. it
was replaced before the special function to set them runs.

____

It could be something to do with 2.6.x but not too sure

Nor am I. There is also an open bug:

hmm def not related to that bug or at least I don’t think it is

____

I wanted to use the system:id - > not: {$ds-members-who-took-action:0}

____

added not functionality will send separate PR for that

____

but the string was always `not: 0` rather than `not: {$ds-members-who-took-
action:0}`

I start to understand. I do use stuff like that, but it's a 2.3 installation.
I can not say if there is a difference with 2.6.

____

that’s the hacky solution I put just to have an idea

____

I renamed the dsParamFilters in my datasource...

Indeed, that looks hacky!  
If your issue is a bug, it will probably not be an easy one. Will require a
lot of testing, which is always a hassle with ENM.

____

Can you post it on GitHub? With all information that might be useful?

Sure no problem, my gut feeling is that something changed in how datasources
are handled. Because whenever I fiddle with one, the parameters are always
computed within the grab/execute. so my guess is the same is happening here
which is not intended.
