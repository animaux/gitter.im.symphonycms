Hi everyone, i've been trying to send an email with symphony(with local and
production server) and i do not had a good result! Exists another way to send
an email? Like PHPMailer?

____

This is really confusing for me.

Email works extraordinarily well with Symphony. Check your preferences. Choose
Sendmail or SMTP, whatever is configured well (on the server resp. mail
server).

____

On your local machine, probably Sendmail won 't work. On production machines,
ideally both works well.

Nope, it's 02:30 a.m. here in Germany. I have to go to bed now, sorry. But
take a look here: <https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/wiki/Email-in-
Symphony> â€” and if you still have problems, try to describe what you tried as
precise as possible. Just saying "It doesn't work" is not very helpful.

@josealbertorodriguesjunior Unfortunately I have no time to do some tests at
the moment. But please post the issue [on
Github](https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/issues), so we can care for
it. Please provide the Symphony and ETM version, as well as **steps to
reproduce the issue**! (You still have not told us what you have done before
you saw the error message.)

@TwoWholeWorms Agreed. I've found a Google search appending `site:gitter.im`
trawls its static archives pretty well.

Is there a way to populate a field with uuid on entry creation or does it need
to be done through an extension?
