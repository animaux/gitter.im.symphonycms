@jonmifsud have you been coming across this problem again lately?
<https://github.com/symphonists/cacheabledatasource/issues/13#issuecomment-102370291>

____

Association Field + Cacheable DS

Not sure how I got around it, but I don't use the association output field as
much

____

As in I prefer to chain creates leaner xml

Hmn, but is it really leaner? I would expect it simply to be smaller main
entries but extra-entries later on. Is that faster mySQL-wise?

Isnt the main purpose of association output to create leaner xml?

no it’s supposed to make you lazy :)

____

it’s leaner if you have repeated items (which I tend to have) multiple entries
with the same output

I'd say "faster"

____

I see... but I have lots of usecases where I have a main entry thats
associated to multiple other sections of which I often only need one or two
values in the frontend - using association output over datasource chaining is
a huge win here!

but for example I have one image section/datasource - and I have up to 30
datasources chaining to it

____

sometimes the same image entry is used 2/3 times depending on context

____

association output reduces effectiveness/speed  & increases XML

____

though dev wise the output is ‘faster’ to possibly setup than chaining

Sure... as soon as you start to have the same data twice in the XML it's
probably better to use datasource-chaining. But for everything else
association output is a bless :)

@jonmifsud ok, I seldom have the same output in multiple entries. So I go for
lazy.

Agreed! And for ~~all too bloated~~ cases _with loads of unique entries_ it
would be nice if the `cacheable datasourse` would work.

I think I had figured out how to make it work - not sure if I have an update
on cacheable ds.

I’m out of the office today - attending a meeting relating to Malta having the
EU presidency - but if you ping me tomorrow (unless I get bored today and
leave early) I’ll be able to check what I’ve set up

Custom datasource: is there a way to filter text input for NULL values

something like $this- >dsParamFILTERS['733'] = 'not-regexp:^$';
