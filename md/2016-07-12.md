Whoa, sorry everyone, been a little busy at work

____

@nilshoerrmann Yes, I'm currently focusing on modularity and testing, not
changing the existing feature set, but looking at how it could be extended

____

For example, swapping loggers, profilers, templating, databases, cache layers

____

And yep, Composer can be interacted with via the command line or via the web

____

@reygoch @michael-e Table design is actually interesting

With Doctrine, our 'style' of tables would be multi table inheritance, whereas
'flat' would be single table inheritance

____

Doctrine allows you to choose whatever you like per  'model'

____

So some models can be a big table with all the columns, others can be spread
across many tables like we currently have

I think in general performance seems ok - the _blocker_ which I think would be
there regardless seems to be sorting on large datasets. (having delved into my
queries) - so performance wise in general I don’t think we’re losing much with
multiple tables.

____

ah :) so there’s not really a big argument for vs against I guess

Yeah, both work in different scenarios

____

Doctrine gets away with it because the developer can choose the most
appropriate one with their domain knowledge

____

I 'd be interested in experimenting how we could achieve a similar thing

____

Doctrine has this concept of  'embeddables', which when 'saved', get flattened
into multiple columns

____

But yeah, haven 't got that far down the path yet. A lot of work needs to be
done to split apart the core so it's not so tightly coupled

Alex, while you’re right about the dash/hyphen issue, I don’t think the main
issues of the admin UI lie in the used font. The main hurdle is the structure
and markup that dates back to a different time of web design. It’s quite
inflexible if you think about a more app-like design.

Material Design is very interesting indeed. But it’s a challenging task to get
it right (animations are a core concept) and to give it an individual touch.
I’m not sure if it works outside the Google bubble (similar to iOS designs not
working outside the Apple bubble). And Symphony is not platform specific. I
think Material Design is a great source of inspiration though.

I started playing around with restyling the backend a while ago. It was just a
little side project for personal use but I've got it working as an extension
and it's not too far off being 'releasable'. I'll post a few screenshots in
case they're of interest to anyone.

____

The aims were – keep things simple, reflect modern UI design, address some of
the backend 's weaknesses on larger/smaller screens, and keep fairly close to
the existing layout (if it ain't broke don't fix it!)

I do that all the time (see screenshots on KM 3,7 in this thread), at least
some basic coloring. But that can be done easily with `backend_assets` or
`backend_add_script`. So custom backend styles can simply keep being
extensions.

The hard thing with the Symphony backend is it's used in _so_ many different
ways. One very simple idea I had for the entries table was to only show the
first column on small screens. I imagine this would work well for a lot of
people, but less so for others.

The other thing I looked at was allowing the entries table to overflow
horizontally, meaning it could be scrolled side to side. This works quite well
when you know the table scrolls, but there 's a danger of users not
knowing/realising the table scrolls.

Essentially it's just the example above but scrollable horizontally to reveal
the additional columns. It's a good solution but it's not easily discoverable

This is actually the interesting part about Symphony in my eyes: how to design
with so much flexibility in mind that it „just works“.  
Question is: Why do all design discussion revolve around colors and fonts and
style? I’m not excluding myself here: we don’t have a design solution for the
tables that fits Symphony. Why is that so? And why are we trying to get around
solving this design issue?

____

The important questions:

  1. Why does the table view on the desktop works so well?
  2. What doesn’t work on mobile currently (expect for the fact that it looks garbled at the moment)

____

To turn the question around:

  1. Does the table actually work well on the desktop?
  2. Is the table view on mobile actually not working?

I'd say tables are unparalleled for comparing data both within a set (looking
across a row) and between sets (up and down columns).  
Cards are somewhat simpler, less good for comparison, but better suited at
handling images.  
Each has its strength, but it depends on the content.

@nilshoerrmann from a usability view I would say maybe the mobile and perhaps
the desktop could be a bit more "tap target" -centric. Some parts are already
but other parts are very small target. It works already though. Aesthetically,
discarding thoughts on colour, maybe the UI could look a bit more
contemporary. Looks a little bit like my online bank at the moment.

Tables work as tables for me, but they're very traditional. I'd go for cards
or maybe single horizontal cards in place of rows but they can be of various
height to fit more data. Many online stores have a Row/Thumb switcher on their
product category frontend pages that might be good.

@munki-boy I'd agree it doesn't feel so contemporary, and most <inputs> feel
very small. If the backend was something only I was using, I wouldn't see that
as an issue. But with clients I think this stuff matters – if their first
impression is that Symphony looks like their online bank then it's not
something they're going to feel positive about using. When I set clients up
using Ghost or Siteleaf they're really positive (especially if they're used to
Wordpress or a legacy CMS) – I'd love to get the same reaction from Symphony!

For tables there are solutions for example (random)
<https://github.com/filamentgroup/tablesaw>. That doesn't look bad and is
usable. An overflow-x will do also a great part of the trick. Tables aren't
that bad, there are people who can't live without an app called exel, that is
based on columns, rows and cells (ironic touch here)

But how many people should really maintain their website on a mobile device.
Sure if you want to change that single word you have misspelled it's handy. A
simple only show the first row of the table could solve that approach. But
can't imagine that someone do all of his content on a mobile device.

I don't think the 'interface' of symphony isn't that bad. Does it look sexy.
Not really but it does the job right.

Colors, font, font-sizes etc. doesn't make a good system better.

it's a bit of a 'chicken and egg' scenario too – people won't do it if it's
not easy.

@moretaste: I tend to disagree with that line of thinking; if design wins, the
car doesn't crash. For me, that means my client does a task in 6 seconds
instead of 10, or instead of bouncing. With Symphony, in all honesty, I think
the tabular display is one of the most effective parts of the current
interface, just by nature of its flexibility. Yes, there's a bit of a
breakdown when there are loads of columns and/or when screen sizes decrease,
but I've found that a tablesaw-esque solution (column priority and stacking on
mobile) effectively accommodates those scenarios and use cases.

@jonmifsud: I've dealt a lot with that exact use case, very valid

Yes, tables are the most efficient way to display content. Simply adding
checkboxes to select on which responsive breakpoint each field should be
visible would solve this problem.

Some aesthetic design elements become global symbols and therefore are
recognisable to large groups of end users. Some practical elements such as
items large enough to finger tap rather than accurately pointer-click have
become the contemporary aesthetic. Modern might be a bad choice of word but
contemporary UI is what end-users are familiar with. Not easy to separate -
take the best of both.

live stories are shorts. That is a create new and not a table view where you
need to find back an article or product you've edited before. Cars that don't
crash sounds awesome. But I don't want to be the devil's advocate for sure.

Yes they would be short but you still have to navigate the menu and you might
have multiple people who want to look around. Not as simple as you think :)

make things as simple as possible but not simpler (einstein).
<http://yourdomain/symphony/publish/yoursection/new/> (that is just a link)
you could even make in the frontend where are colleagues are around (the edit
this link isn't even that hard anyway)
