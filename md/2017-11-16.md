@wdebusschere yes, but this problem also exists on other servers. The same
problem is present on sites on our Ubuntu 14 server running PHP 5.6.

@nitriques did `2.7.0beta2` to `2.7.x current` change anything regarding the
prepopulation of text fields?

Can anyone reproduction that propoluation of textarea fields viw URL is not
working in current `2.7.x` branch code? (E. g.
/symphony/publish/SECTION/new/?prepopulate[FIELD-ID]=Testtext)

@jonmifsud did you have problems with AI selector interface not finding
entries? I can only solve this by setting the limit to a large number of
entries which should not be neccessary if I understand the function right.

I thought the default setting of 20 entries means search results, e. g. if you
type `the` it shows you the first 20 matches. However it seems it limits the
number of entries that are searched in the first place. So if the first 20 do
not match the search term, there are no results. Even when there are plenty
matches in later entries.

Apparently the problem lies elsewhere … another `2.7.x current` seems to work
…

Oh wait, that was obvoisly not the MOST recent version. Something must have
changed.

Current version fails to prepopulate textareas.

I wonder how many other fields will need to be updated for this?
