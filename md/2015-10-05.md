@spitcat I think you might have gotten the wrong “Symphony” are you using the
Symfony Framework?

@jonmifsud: Sorry, I haven't followed Gitter for a while. Have you managed to
get the ENM working?

Oh yes

__ __

had sent the PR :)

__ __

I still need to check in regards to removing all the includes after adding the
autoloader.

__ __

Demoed the ENM last week, probably the first mailshot will go out either this
or next week from production, depending on the client.

Cool. Regarding the cleanup: Do what you feel comfortable with, and I will try
to do the rest. See creativedutchmen/email_newsletter_manager#67

__ __

BTW: Make sure that email addresses are valid. I had some problems with that
(creativedutchmen/email_newsletter_manager#63)

yep seen that, just need to find some time and test it out. But it’s pretty
neat would probably use ENM for my own newsletters at some point.

__ __

ah I think it should be fine I had set the member’s extension ‘email’ field

__ __

I guess that should be robust enough though I ‘did’ have an issue with XML
importer because of the unique validation when updating entries. Not sure if I
should add it as an issue (as not quite sure what a solid solution would be)

I have never used the XML importer, so I can't say anything about it
spontaneously. (Instead I am using custom background processes. This is where
my suggested autoloader code comes from.)

have a few crons - I use XML importer for simple importing / updating when
migrating sites or other initial data to Symphony. Issue is that you can
basically set a ‘unique’ field to update the entry with. However the validator
breaks because the email is non unique. It’s trivial to fix by disabling the
unique check (as the importer is doing a unique check) but as a proper fix no
idea how to go about it. but I guess there haven’t been other complaints so
it’s not a big issue
