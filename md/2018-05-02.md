____

assuming you have the entry object

you can use field Manager if you have a situation where don’t know the ID of
the field as its dynamic by field name.

I would test the template first. (You may need some fallback values in data
sources for this.)

____

Then I would create a recipient group with a single recipient (me).

Then I would send a simple email, then the email that went wrong.

At a certain point it should break. (I mean, it should not, but you say that
it will!)

my log file, like "recipient address rejected" or "domain not found". (And my
system sends a lot of mail, believe me.) I hope that you can find out what
