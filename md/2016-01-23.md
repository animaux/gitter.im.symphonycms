Anybody who has ever managed to have a "conditionally required" field (based
on the value of another field)?

hmm conditionally required not within the backend...

____

what I had was Javascirpt UI changing possible values for Association Field
depending on values from another field

____

kind of filtering with javascript - association field data. But no validation
checks on save.

I wold love to have pimped field validation, but I haven't found a way to do
it with delegates. Not yet...

I never quite required it.. or else it would have been a frontend requirement
really which was taken care of with jQuery or event customization.

OK, I will try nevertheless. I wouldn't like to have both, JS for one field
and backend validation for others.

I think you should be able to do it with a preSave delagate or something of
the sort… I don’t think you can make it ‘required’ (as symphony standard
behaviour) but you should be able to throw a custom error saying that the
required field is missing.

@munki-boy Current integration is broken and it's my fault

We need to add more delegates for this... I am very open to it @michael-e

I solved my above issue by hacking a delegate inside Symphony's checkPostData
function. If you like, I can open an issue on Github to add this delegate
(including my code, so we can discuss it).
