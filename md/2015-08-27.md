I guess the younger the more time you get to spend I guess, unless you’re too
overloaded with work and morgages

start picking up some local work, diversifying a bit.

chitchat!

__ __

a question about the date field. If I fill in only a year it returns this:  
`<opleiding-1-van iso="1970-01-01T01:33:03+01:00" timestamp="1983"
time="01:33" weekday="4" offset="+0100">1970-01-01</opleiding-1-van>`

__ __

Only the timestamp got the year, is that a bug or expected behaviour?

If the date doesn't have the intended year value, the timestamp shouldn't have
it either. This sounds like a bug. The values should be the same for all
representations.

Date field is a core field I think so I should make a issue at the symphony
repository.

__ __

For now I should force users to fill in a complete date through a jquery
plugin as a workaround

Meh the output in the backend doesnt. I understand the epoch is right but the
conversion to the 'visual' date isnt

The issue is closed so I guess I have to accept it that it technically seems
to be right but never can't explain it to my client. Up to a js datapicker
that force the visitor to input a complete date.

this kind of discussions reminds me of the old days where programmers were
technically true, but the designer thought hell yeah. Assumption is the mother

@moretaste: He, please don't be so angry. On Github some folks really tried to
explain why things work this way, and that your data model is the issue. You
want to input values (i.e. years) into a date field which **are not dates**,
and you would like them to be "magically parsed" (into what?). But a date is a
(localized) point in time, not a range (so: not a year, not a month).

Not angry. It was my assumption that was the mistake.
