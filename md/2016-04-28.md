Finally it works! ... but ... etm execute multiple time. Is there a way/trick
to execute etm only once?

For the clarity I post now to one section with the expect-multiple filter.
First I validate the post array and return each result back in the xml for
error messages. If all entries valid than I do an execute(). Works for me as
expected.

I don't understand why you use the expect-multiple filter, but this might be
your problem with the ETM. If multiple entries are saved using expect-
multiple, all other filters (also the ETM email filter) are executed for every
entry. This is Symphony standard.

____

If you just want to send text emails and you even validate data while the
event is executed, you might think about using the core email API directly in
your event as explained here: <https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/wiki
/Email-in-Symphony#using-the-core-email-api-programatically>

You could as well use the ETM programatically in your event (instead of adding
the ETM's filter to the event). You should be able to generate all the output
with:

____

    
    
     require_once(EXTENSIONS . '/email_templates/lib/class.emailtemplatemanager.php');
    
    $template = EmailTemplateManager::load('my-test-template');
    $template->addParams(
        array(
            'etm-entry-id' => $entry_id,
        )
    );
    $output = $template->render();

____

And the you can use this output to send an email with the core email API:

____

    
    
     $email = Email::create();
    try {
        $email->setRecipients = array(
            'John Doe' => 'john@example.com',
        );
        $email->setSubject   = $output['subject'];
        $email->setTextPlain = $output['plain'];
        $email->setTextHtml  = $output['html'];
    
        $email->send();
    } catch (EmailGatewayException $e) {
        throw new SymphonyErrorPage('Error sending email. ' . $e->getMessage());
    } catch (EmailException $e) {
        throw new SymphonyErrorPage('Error sending email. ' . $e->getMessage());
    }

Actually it's a bit more complicated if you have more configuration for the
email template. You'd have to check the template output, then add this to the
email (if not empty). Example:

____

    
    
     if (isset($content['reply-to-email-address'])) {
        $email->setReplyToEmailAddress = $content['reply-to-email-address'];
