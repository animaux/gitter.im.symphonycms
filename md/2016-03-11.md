So I simultaneously love and hate you guys. I love you guys because Symphony
is awesome and I rebuilt my parents' business website in 2 days and it's way
better now than it was before. I hate you guys because apparently the guy I
interviewed with over Skype, who I interview with in person next week, meant
Symfony... :(

It's more of just a general PHP Development gig (which I have 3.5 years
experience with) but he said they plan on using Symfony (which I have none).
But given they're pronounced the same over Skype I screwed up.

I like Symphony though, enjoyed learning to use it. Now I've got 4 days to
start learning Symfony.

____

One would assume Symphony was built using Symfony components too, but I see
that 's not the case, lol.

set up

Yea, I'd probably use it for a personal project. But maybe I'll end up loving
Symfony too, we'll see. :P

@neosatus D'oh! Symfony is a framework not a CMS: It's a different tool

Yea, and after going back and googling Symphony framework and having it tell
me "Don't you mean Symfony?" I must've googled Symphony CMS, so I have no one
to blame but myself. :P

____

I like Symphony way more than Drupal, that 's for sure.

Just checked my search history, I actually searched for symphony tutorial. =\

____

But at least I got to meet you nice people and get the lead dev into an
internet argument my first day learning it, so I 've got that going for me,
which is nice.

____

But yea, I 'm gonna focus on learning Symfony for now, maybe I'll be back
later!

<https://css-tricks.com/what-is-a-headless-cms/> well, finally the "web dev
community" is starting understand what Allen Chang already knew for much more
than a decade.

____

since 2001 I guess, not sure how Symphony development starts.

____

I 'm on FOX Studios right now, we use Drupal 7 for fox.com and well... it's so
bad comparing to symphony in so many ways. Drupal have a lot powerfull
features actualy that made it somehow good choice, but the bad parts is very
bad, mostly comparing with symphony.

____

future plans is move the project to API-driven approach. thats when I had the
opportunity to show off Symphony for the tech director.

____

API-driven, or Data-driven approach will never get old, because the content is
actually the company product, technologies change, the company remains, also
the content created by the company.

I'll keep pushing Symphony here whenever is possible. This project still dont
have any match competitor as a CMS. the backend interface is so great for
content producers, and so simple.

____

I wonder if you guys have future plans for Symphony, or just maintain the v2.
the version 2 is very mature and solid stuff by the way.

____

the problem when I try to sell is always the XSLT, and the workflow for
database updates is not clear or easy.

____

please let me know. I 'm trying to find or make opportunities with this tool,
it's very hard, but I'm getting close. I have feedbacks that can put this CMS
back in the competition if you want to know. Also, to make clear, I'm not a
PHP developer, so thats the reason I didnt made the changes myself.

I have a prototype working with react as isomorphic application and symphony,
it pretty modern stuff, no matter xslt, fyi. :)

____

it taking almost 7 years to the launch of Drupal 8, they included twig and
going for api-approach. but the backend interface still confuse, development
workflow is confuse, maintenance is difficult. and I think D8 are still making
assumptions on how to structure the markup... so... so big and powerfull
community still dont understand what a template engine exist for........

in any case, at the moment I could go back to work with Symphony (doing my
best to make this happen), I'll start contributing in CSS and JS. I just dont
have time now b/c I have to deal with other tools (very limited time).

____

thanks everyone, cheers
