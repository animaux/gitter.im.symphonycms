p.s. can't find Symphony on LinkedIn through Google or through their own

Are there any plans in the pipeline to get try and get more extensions tested
and listed as compatible with the latest Symphony? Would definitely be happy
to chip in, even if my input would mostly be limited to testing and logging
issues on GH.

Also, I think I saw someone else suggest as some point having a sort of
graveyard* on the extensions site (where old extensions go to die) – I think
it makes sense that while older incompatible extensions should still be
findable (in case someone wants to resuse code/resurrect them), they should be
a bit harder to find. I think when new users see extensions that haven't been
updated since 2011 it makes Symphony look like a piece of history, a
perception that's quite damaging.

° by this I mean a way of categorising an extension as obsolete, so it doesn't
show up alongside current extensions.

@johnpuddephatt they should me mark as deprecated in the xml file...

and for the matrix, i realise the new symphony version are there, but the
matrix is not up to date...

ah yes sorry, they are marked as deprecated yes! It's quite obvious on the
individual extension page but it's hard to tell on the listings pages, the
gray isn't that obvious.

I noticed in the main getsymphony website the logo is somehow trimmed on the
bottom, does anybody see that also?

__ __

In that case, the fix could be in setting line-height: 1.6em in [#nameplate a]
selector, in core.css

__ __

which is currently having a value of 1.5, doh :)

I see within an extension code a query using `tbl_entries_data_...` whereas in
my db table list I see `sym_entries_data…`; is there a built-in function for
changing the prefix, or it is just old code?

I believe the msql class takes care of the 'tbl' prefix and it gets changed to
'sym_' or whatever you specify on install.

@nitriques login on getsymphony.com works for me now.. I was typing the wrong
password!! hahah interestingly it didn't inform me I was entering the wrong
information though.
