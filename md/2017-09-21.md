Hi. Any idea about this error? => array_reduce() expects parameter 2 to be a
valid callback, non-static method SectionEvent::__reduceType() should not be
called statically. => symphony/lib/toolkit/events/class.event.section.php
around line 96

@nitriques Thank you very much. I thought that error was coming from member
plugin itself, that's why I was looking for a version of member plugin
compatible with 2.7.x. However I fixed it with applying the 2.7.x version of
this file => symphony\lib\toolkit\class.entry.php , but now I'm getting above
error.

Hi all, I just figured out that above mentioned error occurs when the password
field of the member plugin is not strong enough. So that we enter a weak
password in the front end say something like 123456 as an example, we get the
following error => array_reduce() expects parameter 2 to be a valid callback,
non-static method SectionEvent::__reduceType() should not be called
statically. => symphony/lib/toolkit/events/class.event.section.php around line
96
