Has anyone used JIT with animated GIFs before?

And if so how do I get them to work :grimacing: As soon as I put an animated
gif through JIT it becomes static

@pixelninja JIT is not able to process animated gifs. They will become static.
You could bypass them in your xsl, but then they will not be scaled. I did
something like that for SVG a while ago. I can look up the code if you like,
but itâ€™s rather straightforward.

I guess there is no way to select the language of event errors other than
setting the backend language? Would be nice if this was selectable with a
param.

Hi all, can someone please tell me how to setup a json response on ajax call
to the Symphony ? I setup a page as json and when I do the ajax call it still
sends me some XML. Some clue please.
