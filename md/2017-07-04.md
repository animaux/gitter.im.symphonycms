@poojabl I think you have the wrong forum. This is the forum for [Symphony
CMS](http://www.getsymphony.com), not Symfony

Hi All. I have an installation of Sym 2.6.11 on Ubuntu 16 with PHP 5.6. I
developed it on Ubuntu 14 without issue. On the Ubuntu 16 server I get a
filtering error only on one particular section:

"An error occurred while retrieving filtered entries. Showing all entries
instead."

Can anyone suggest how this error might arise and where I could look to fix
it?

hey guys, long time no see :) is this still the place for updates? the site
looks like no one touched it in a while. i have several projects coming up for
which i would like to use symphony 2.7. what is the estimated release date? is
it save to use right now or should i go with the 2.6 branch instead?

Email Template Manager question - Has anyone managed to log emails sent by
ETM? I vaguely remember seeing it somewhere but could be wrong.

@azzagazz I found the `2.7.0.beta` and the `RC` to be quite stable. If you
want to be on the safe side you can stick with `2.6.11` for the time being.

____

A collegue of mine found an odd thing about symphony authors/managers. If you
are a `manager` you can demote yourself to an `author`. After that there is no
way back though â€¦

@nitriques I found that the logs were not being written (no /logs/ directory).
I created it and changed the manifest folder permissions and the problem has
gone away :-)

____

So thanks for your help :-)
