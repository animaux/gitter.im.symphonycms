@jonmifsud I've done it multiple times... log in with your account that has
access to the org: they will be listed below your own

hmm

____

possible I have to revoke access

____

and re give access from github?

____

@nitriques seems that doesn’t work… can’t log in again… I guess it’s not
clearing/renewing my token properly...

nope just had mine…

____

now can’t seem to login anymore :/

____

wanted to release  > <https://github.com/mazedigital/group_lock>

____

was thinking if I should or not, but I think it would benefit the community.
It’s how I solved my permission stuff

nope - I didn’t see it in the list view so couldn’t try to release it. I have
push access as I just created/pushed the repo organisation I created so I
don’t see why there’d be an issue unless I have to give permissions in another
way to the organisation

It has been like this for a long time, so it doesn't have to do with the
server move.

@michael-e I have a feeling that nicks’ app requests access to personal repo
by default.

____

probably someone added symphonists before you logged in and it defaults to
that one...

____

@nitriques maybe has both as he was added into symphonists later…

____

trying to create a scenario that makes sense...
