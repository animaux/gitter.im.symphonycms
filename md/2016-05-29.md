So 2days ago i wanted to add effects to JIT, but i have to admit it s quite
complicated to implement simpleimage class. I did not make it, so I tried to
do it the JIT way, but only with the class, here is the result of my
experiment <https://vimeo.com/168568054>

i didn 't find a way to replace JIT Image class with simpleimage class. but
perhaps it could be good to implement as a JIT v3 ;-)

@nitriques the adaptative_resize used in the video is exactly what is missing
to JIT
