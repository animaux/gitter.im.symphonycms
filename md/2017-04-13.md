@nitriques / @michael-e \- I guess I’ll build it and send a PR - there’s also
a couple of things which are current feature requests which I might tackle.

@jonmifsud we tried to do something similar before with a bulk import and set
a default random pwd for each user (so that it got sent to the DB) then sent
the invite out with that pwd and encouraged them to set their own pwd when
activating account. The bulk import didn't work though as the password wasn't
being set correctly on import.

@andrewminton you mean this one?

I don’t remember … :worried:

But it sound like  @moretaste made it work with the solution he mentioned back
then. In case that’s your same problem now.

Yes that's the thread. Bypassing encryption of certain fields is my error.
Migrating members using xmlimporter so looking if others have come across
different solutions.

@michael-e Why is it sloppy ? Because variable should always defined ? If you
always declare it, I guess it's ok, but I do not like `if ($var)` statement
because they are unclear about the intention of the developer. Is it missing
something ? I would rather see `if (!!$var)` then you know the other programer
wanted to do. I wonder if there are any PSR recommendation on this.

Generally my question is about the following: Should we rather make PHP throw
errors (which can be fixed) if a needed variable is undefined or should we use
constructs like `empty()` which will never throw an error (thus make such
mistakes much harder to find). I'd prefer the first.

yes and no; I think if we mean to send/throw an error it can probably be more
constructive if you actually throw an error with the full details rather than
just a standard 500 server error.

Well, the error that is thrown will depend on the implementation (e.g.
try/catch with Symphony error, or just a plain PHP error). My question here —
from a developer's perspective — is: Do we **want** an error to occur, or just
a  "silent fail" (using `empty()`) in our code). I think that those "silent
fails" are not good for code quality.

Well empty is not always a silent fail: sometimes, you want to prevent a fatal
crash. If the $var being empty is a catastrophe, you should throw. If not, I
do not see the problem

@andrewminton @animaux did I accidentilly solve something or do you guys need
some more response? I didn't had the time to read all back

For the error part, in js I normally would try to catch all possible errors.
And if it goes to the front-end explain it in human language what went wrong.
I think the same what Jonathan said. If it is possible I pass a default value
to a variable so at least the intention of the function can be clear. Dunno if
this counts for php also.
