I did some work the other day on my flight home from New Zealand for adding
XSLT template support to Laravel

____

Was an interesting exercise coding without internet!

Hey peeps! first time to this room.

____

Quick question. Is there a setting to suppress symphony errors on the front of
a site via config? or is it htaccess level control?

Thinking how Laravel exposes the error reporting functionality in developer
mode and then suppresses it all once deployed. At least from a visible trace
anyways.

you’re saying 500 server errors right?

____

There’s a way to do it via custom 500 error pages.

I mean where there's any type of templating error on the front end for some
reason. Rather than expose the CMS or show the error, render a blank white
page or show something less daunting to the user?? if a custom error 500 would
do that then yes, that's what I'm after.

____

But only if you are in live/deployed mode... you can switch it on via a config
or something maybe??

I can send you over what I have maybe, basically for a set of them I have a
url-parameter I use to view errors (done through the custom 500) for some of
them I’m not sure you can switch but everything comes in the logs anyway.

____

I think you can change it to use config settings too

OOh. If you wouldn't mind yes. I'm just curious to know how to apply something
like this to a current site. You have my email right?
