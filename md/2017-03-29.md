Hi guys, what's the best way of doing redirects in Symphony, I have this
structure - root/webpage/pagename and I want to remove "webpage" from the URL
- so root/pagename. It is only for this specific case as the other URL's are
how I want them, root/section/params. Is it best to just do a htaccess
redirect or is there a "Symphony" way to do it?  
Thanks.

@peterfleck_twitter
[url_router](http://symphonyextensions.com/extensions/url_router/) will do the
trick.

So, I recently learned to store what I would call a pointer to an XPath
selection into a variable, e.g.

    
    
    <xsl:variable name="foo1" select="//foo-ds/entry[bar1/item/@handle = //params/url-bar]" />
    <xsl:variable name="foo2" select="//foo-ds/entry[bar2/@handle = //params/url-bar]" />

Meaning I can access nodes and attibrutes with selections like `<xsl:value-of
select="$foo2/name/@handle" />`. Neat.

However, suppose I want to assign one of those to another variable following a
logic test, e.g.

    
    
    <xsl:variable name="foo-choice">
        <xsl:choose>
            <xsl:when test="$foo1">
                ? $foo1
            </xsl:when>
            <xsl:otherwise>
                ? $foo2
            </xsl:otherwise>
        </xsl:choose>
    </xsl:variable>

What XSLT should I put in place of the question marks? `<xsl:copy-of
select="$foo1" />` doesn't work as I thought it might, and requires using EXSL
later in the template, e.g. `<xsl:apply-templates select="exsl:node-set($foo-
choice)" />`. My aim is to avoid repetative lengthy XPath selections.

@cylkee You can use exsl and node-set. Works fine. You just have to declare it
in the header.

@cylkee @animaux is right: <http://exslt.org/> is really powerfull

____

@animaux yes your convertion are ok. The replacement string actually contains
code, so converting to a lambda function is the thing to do

@animaux no 5.1 has been dropped since 2.6. It surely can run with some
modification, but I do not test it

@michael-e ok thanks that quite a lot of pages. Are you using the page field ?

____

@michael-e thanks for the comment but it still can be backward compatible with
5.6 (so it should not be a breacking change)

I have sites running on MySQL 5.1, too. Seems fine.

@nitriques: Yes, I am using the page field. Why do you ask?

____

Regarding the Symphony version: Of course, if it is backwards compatible…
Still the Symphony site says  "PHP 5.3 or above" (and so does the repository's
README), so we won't really have semantic versioning…

@nitriques @animaux Thanks, I was hoping to avoid `exsl:node-set()`, which I
have been using in other projects. My thinking is, if I can do...

    
    
    <xsl:variable name="foo1" select="//foo-ds/entry[bar1/item/@handle = //params/url-bar]" />
    <xsl:variable name="foo2" select="$foo1" />

...then surely there's a way to do this redeclaration in a logic if/then/else
kinda way. I've already trawled the W3C XSLT and XPath pages, but hoping there
was something I'd missed that was standard and not EXSL.

@michael-e would be interesting to see if Symphony CMS 2.6.11 runs on PHP 5.3?

Hmmm, no, not that I am aware of. Frontend or backend?
