@kirkstrobeck it very much depends on your setup; either you don’t have a
Symphony Page setup properly; or else you have a datasource which is set to
trigger a 404

Ok, the trick is to use `execute()` from the section class. This works now for
me:

    
    
        protected function __trigger()
        {
          // Clear POST for custom submit
          unset($_POST['fields']);
          // Copy inital POST values
          $_POST['fields'] = $this->post[$this->ROOTELEMENT]['fields'];
          // Execute
          $result=$this->execute();
    
          if($result->getAttribute('result') == "success") {
          // Get parent ID
            $related_id = $result->getAttribute('id');
            // Clear POST for custom submit
            unset($_POST['action'][$this->ROOTELEMENT]);
            unset($_POST['fields']);
            // Copy initial POST values and set association
            $_POST['fields'] = $this->post['create-sub']['fields'];
            $_POST['fields']['related-main'] = [$related_id];
            $_POST['action']['create-sub'] = 'Submit';
            // $result=$this->execute();
          }
            return $result;
        }

Next part is to submit more than one subs

Quick question maybe @michael-e or someone else has tried it out. [Members
Supports multiple sections](https://github.com/symphonycms/members/wiki
/Multiple-Sections), any caveats that I should be aware of before going that
way?

I tried it a long time ago... As far as I remember, a Member can not be logged
in to multiple member sections at the same time. That might be a show stopper.
I suggest to test that, or maybe ask @brendo.

@michael-e that’s fine; I don’t want them to log into both

one is for a `client` to manage certain parts and the other is for an `end

the end user has more details/restrictions… and we have data inside already so
it will be quicker to use that.. just migrate a standard email field in to a
members email field..

Hmm, so apache 2.0 is a strict requirement?

__ __

I was starting with <https://hub.docker.com/_/php/>

php:5.6, apache2, mysql 5.5 -- would be pretty difficult to update apache
