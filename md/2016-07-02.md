Thanks for that tip, but the same error

____

`_email_error` creates the specific error (incorrect authentication)

Ah ffs (lets say it is an user error :D) ... I didn't change the host
(127.0.0.1) :blush: because I thought that was the endpoint on the helo
hostname.

Insert here your roflmao

Pity the production server has again a block. But test server works now.

The `HELO hostname` is Symphony's webserver, but the `Host` is the email
server you connect to. Any progress on the production machine?

External sys admin there and it is weekend so I think I will have a response
monday. One of the reasons I'm gonna move all websites from there. But on my
own server it works with those settings, so I trust that it also will on the
production server.
