Is there a way to read the current data / data sources and set new parameters
on the page via a event (php) on load?

@wdebusschere i need to read the page's data sets from a event script rather
than through a individual data source script

@Huttch can you elaborate a bit more? Maybe then its better to access the data
without datasource

@wdebusschere i am using a EVENT on page load using the load() function but
need to access/read some variables / parameters from the params and returned
datasources attached to the page the event is running on inside the event
load() function.
