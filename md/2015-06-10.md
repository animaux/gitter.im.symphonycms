Hey Guys, came across a pretty strange / unwanted bug. Not sure if anyone came
across before. One of my clients likes to embed tweets directly into the
Markdown editor. However it seems that symphony breaks if the original tweet
contains emoticons. I think thereâ€™s a special character which breaks the
conversion / saving in database. In fact the markdown version was cropped off
mid tweet. Side-effect it crashed the whole site - so will def be looking for
a way to fix it but any previous experience would certainly help. - Client is
on latest stable.

yep just came across the first one - thanks for the details you provided in
the 2nd one - will be great to strip those characters out.
