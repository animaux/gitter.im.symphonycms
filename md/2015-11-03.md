@munki-boy we can't add it to the core since .jpe is not a "recognized" jpeg
extension. But you can override it without touching the core: just put a
validators.php file in the manifest like so
<https://github.com/DeuxHuitHuit/symphony-2-template/blob/dev/manifest/validators.php>

__ __

change 'image' to whatever suits you
(<https://github.com/DeuxHuitHuit/symphony-2-template/blob/dev/manifest/validators.php#L12>)

@nitriques that's brilliant, exactly what I need and without hitting the core
files. I can make my own custom types in there so people find what they're
expecting. :+1:

It's default for sometimes for cameras or apps, or I think anyone saving a
file in certain programs or even web browsers if its file extension
autocomplete is alphabetic because it comes first. I think this is the case in
FF even today when someone saves a file without an extension already written
in the end of the filename, or if the filename has some extra data appended at
the end, FF will add .jpe because that's the first thing it finds out of the
allowed suffixes.

Wow. This is new to me, thanks! But yeah, a custom validatior file is what you
need! Fell free to copy/change mine!

Try it, not sure what the client is doing but maybe if you grab a uri like
this one

In FF then right-click&gt;save image as... you'll get a ".jpe" suffix unless
you add ".jpg" yourself. I guess because ".jpe" is the first suffix suggested
alphabetically. Not tried other browsers but it's quite widespread as people
are lazy and modern OS hide the file extension so they just think they have a
jpeg. Well they do have a jpeg but not with a convenient suffix. Also go "save
as..." in photoshop and although it's not default you'll see ".jpe" there
along with ".jpg" etc.

Already pinched and modded your validator thanks again, didn't even know we
could do this, careful to keep the files from manifest folder if I do a clean
install sometime.

Is any of you guys running an automated/timed XML-Import in Symphony `2.6.3`?
The Cron extension seems to be broken. How would we go about this in 2015 or
even 2016? :)

__ __

I guess using the shell-extension and a host-based cronjob should work?

Even `master`?

__ __

I believe @pointybeard is using Cron &amp; Shell right now in production

__ __

But yeah, you won’t even need the shell extension really if you can wget/curl
the importer run URL

AH! thanks Brendo! I was trying `master` instead of `pointybeard/master` …
will try again :)

seems I cloned that from somewhere else a while ago

Hmmm. No luck. `cron` activation fails without any error message … will have a
look in the php-log

You’ll need PHP 5.4+

good stuff!

Ok, Part II.

__ __

Line 2 `include __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';` in the driver results in
`include(/…/extensions/cron/vendor/autoload.php): failed to open stream: No
such file or directory`

I guess this should point to the site root instead?

you’ll need to run `composer install` from inside the extension folder

ummm, ok

I guess this will not be possible on shared hosting without shell access? But
cron without shell access will not be much use either …

Is there any reason you can’t use a normal cron and just curl the XML importer

ah fair enough

__ __

well that’s an optional too

__ __

each importer has a unique URL that you can hit to execute

__ __

Usually we create a ‘cron author’, and then append their access token to the
URL to auto log them in

@animaux Wait! is this a way to automate a timed event on shared hosting? I'd
like to scrape stuff at set times on a shared host but thought it'd need shell
access.
