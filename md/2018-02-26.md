@bzerangue @jonmifsud Iâ€™d agree. As nice as a lot of the stuff in XSLT2 is,
there are easy to use workarounds, templates and functions that can make up
for most of it. Especially if you use EXSLT.

Hi all, a quick question => I want to add an extra XML element(child element
on each element) based on the result(2 dates) that is returned by a Data
Source, where I do a small calculation and then add the mentioned element. Can
someone please tell me the way it can be done ?

What XSLT 3 - Saxon C for PHP, <http://saxonica.com/saxon-c/index.xml?> Can't
really do the workarounds for that. Plus with the interoperability of JSON on
XSLT3... that is huge... especially working with today's technology (the
majority of folks are running away from XML and embracing JSON).

Also, ServerPilot.io just posted a tutorial on getting Saxon/C setup with
their system for cloud servers like Digitalocean, Linode, etc
