@nitriques just wondering - if Symphony where to introduce unit tests or
something of the sort - would we be building on
<https://github.com/symphonists/symphony_tests> ? or would it likely be a
separate integration/platform? Investigating what processes/procedures we are
setting up internally for unit testing etc and would rather be in-line with
what we’d be using on a Symphony side rather than use two different tool sets.

Right now the code is so tied up with the DB that it hard to do. We would need
DI in order to properly unit test the code. But, we could try to do
integration testing... this has been bugguing a lot...

yeah I understand it’s quite a task any idea what frameworks you’d want to
use/implement?
