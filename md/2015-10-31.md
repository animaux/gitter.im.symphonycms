@nitriques but it is the filename "something.jpe" is the same as
"something.jpg" or "something.jpeg" and the problem is that "something.jpe"
will throw this error "File chosen in ‘Image’ does not match allowable file
types for that field." which is not true.

It's not a bug, it's a feature. That's how validation currentlt works

____

.jpe does not match the regular expression

____

You could upload a non-image file if you call it test.jpg

____

The file itself is not validated: only it 's name

____

Just delete the validation rule or use (.*) and all extensions will be allowed

I'm sorry to have caused a lot of replies, I do understand the regex and
everything. I just wanted to have .jpe put into the default regex that comes
with these fields because you have 2 of 3 of the jpeg suffixes and why not all
3? I'll leave this now as I'm taking up your time with something that isn't
causing a site to break. Cheers guys :smile:
