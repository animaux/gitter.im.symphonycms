@michael-e BTW. Shouldnâ€™t the failed TLS-connection not rather create a silent
error instead of triggering a major symphony error?

The error comes from the Symphony core. What exactly do you mean with "major
symphony error" vs. "silent"?

I remember that in the past I had some mail errors resulting in entries being
created, but the error was logged silently. However in this case a symphony
error page is show when trying to send a form (thus triggering the e-mail)

Well, this completely depends on the Symphony core. But once you got the
configuration right, errors shouldn't occur at all.
