@brendo / @nitriques / @nilshoerrmann I’ve got a request by a couple of
clients to make ‘images’ (association fields) searchable by free-text / tags.
I’m tempted to add some kind of support for a tag search. Basically right now
association field searches only the `reflection field` which returns the
aggregated data, search is done using a `like` query which restricts results
to those exactly matching. If I had to put the tags within the reflection
field, and you’d want multiple tags to be present you’d have to write them in
the exact same way/order. Would you think anything of the like would be a
useful addition to the community?

mine.. using reflection field

not sure if I’m using a reflection field fork, but it should work.

____

yes I do, usually I’d put the image, the image url in text (makes image name
searchable + failover in case something is wrong with the image) then I would
put in the caption if available.

yeah I guess that makes sense but when you import a bunch of images without a
title it’s not so straight forward. + having thousands of images titles don’t
help much.

this is the expression I’m using:

`<img src='{entry/image/supported-dimensions/image[@dimension='50x50']}' />
{entry/image/@original-key} <br/> {entry/caption}` Note I am not using a
standard image upload field so you’d have to change a few things.

____

obv once you set reflection you’ll have to re-save the image entries to get
the previews
