@nitriques > <https://github.com/DeuxHuitHuit/sri> is just for frontend stuff
correct? Any best practices of how the same thing could be done for
backend/extensions? Also how do you approach versioning? If you update the
script and the CDN still has the old one; I guess that would break the
functionality with the ‘integrity’ check.

that’s kind of half normal… basically the way it works is; it adds the items
in the param output; then once completed it clears out the items from the

@kirkstrobeck the `grab` method is now called `execute`

____

@jonmifsud Yeah it's just for frontend (i.e. your custom asset)

____

It 's not for versioning _perse_ it 's only for integrity.. But I used a
rewrite rule that accepts the version in the filepath, so I just need to clear
cachelite and the new integrity value is updated (the extension checks the
modified time of files)

I don’t think »allow filtering« has anything to do with conditionlizer though.
It just turns on/off the backend filtering interface of entries.

in your datasource

____

`data.datasourcename.php`there is a function called `execute` previously
`grab` and that is what runs everything. If you check the parameters at that
point you should be able to halt execution or do something else

      public $dsParamFILTERS = array(
        '141' => '{$url-community:no}'
      );
    
      public function execute(array &$param_pool = null)
      {
        $result = new XMLElement($this->dsParamROOTELEMENT);
        if ($this->dsParamFilters[141] == ‘no’) return; 
      }

____

I took the lazy way showing you a ‘return’ but you should really output some
basic XML saying that the execution was stopped. otherwise continue with your
normal datasource

another quick tip. the dsParamFilters can have `named` keys. However if you do
use named keys; make sure you `unset` them as the standard datasource would
throw a 404 or no-match depending on your setup.

Use-cases when you want to `check` a value which you do not want to filter
with.

____

basically your client’s `boss/manager`

I'm trying to build a URL that includes $current-query-string but it's wrapped
in CDATA tags, is there any quick way to deal with it?
