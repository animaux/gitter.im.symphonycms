Does anyone know of a way to access an admin only page using remote login? Use
case: I'm wanting to use Shopify webhooks to update/add entries, and I think
the only way to do this would be to create an admin only page, attach an
event, and customise it to take the POST data from the webhook. But the Remote
Login link provided through the author page is for `/Symphony`only.

This is so sad. If it wasn’t for @nitriques, @jonmifsud and possibly @brendo
I’d have given up all hope.

oh I think because it doesn’t count the chat… I used to be online all the time
but things are becoming quite hectic

FYI I should hopefully be launching a public repo for a client built on
Symphony - I’ll be happy to post the link to the public repo for anyone who
wants to have a look.
