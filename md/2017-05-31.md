@nitriques Malta could be a nice place to explore for a 3yo though `:D` (times
goes so fast)

Trying to install the Snake I instantly get my first error: `System
Requirements Symphony requires PHP 5.6.x or greater to work, however version
5.6.10 was detected.`

____

No prob. I will use PHP7 instead, but still a bug.

Yes prob … `Symphony requires PHP 5.6.x or greater to work, however version
7.0.8 was detected.`

____

Version detection seems flakey.

____

Is is possible the the `.x`-syntax do not work in here: `define('PHP_MAX',
'5.6.x');`?

Using `.0` and `.99` seems to work …

____

_The Snake_ is far more rad than I expected.  @nitriques is it already useful
to give feedback or should we wait until it is further down the road.

It would be a shame to see nothing but the airport in these cities.

So this might become a bigger kind of project…

As long as the french don’t make fun of your canadian accent (not that I know
anything about that).

Its great to see discussion of a meet up. I'd definitely be up for a European
meet up. Paris and Malta both great options.
