What am I doing wrong with XML Importer and Select Box Link? I am trying to
supply relation_id directly in my XML and if I var_dump just at "#
Description: Editing an entry. Entry object is provided.", in the
class.xmlimporter.php I can see the relation_id like this:

____

    
    
     array(2) { 'title' => string(19) "Mere_Golfclub03.jpg" 'select' => array(1) { 'relation_id' => array(1) { [0] => int(159) } } } 

____

Yet my Select Box Link field remains  "None", even though the other field here
"Mere_Golfclub03.jpg" is written to the entry.

____

If I edit the table cell for the entry relation_id directly in the database
and enter  "159", then the Select Box Link shows the correct value in my
section.

@munki-boy I’m currently struggling with XML-Importer too. If I get it right
XI only accepts IDs or entry handles (for id-lookup)

____

Thats why your latter approach works.

____

However my current problem is I want to import to an `association-field` e.g.
`select-box-link-field` via `XML-Importer`. I have multiple comma-separated
entries, plus I need to handelize each value. John was tackling this here:
<http://www.getsymphony.com/discuss/thread/36868/10/#position-181> but there
is no mention of success in the thread …

Looks like he ended up transforming his source-XML via a Symphony XML-Page and
then imported this into the XML-Importer. Will try this …

Guys XML Importer which version are you using?

____

because I think you might want to use ‘integration’ (not quite sure why it was
never released)

you shouldn’t have any problems I think

____

I’ve imported from a Symphony 2.0 beta to an Association Field etc last year.

____

you are right that it only accepts ID’s that’s why you have the php functions,
you can use those to transform whatever content you have into the right format
of data. If you want to give some more details would be happy to help out

Thanks Jon, currently trying the roundabout via a page. This might even be a
better way for me to go since I might need more transformations before import
and I’m more comfortable with XSLT then PHP.

I'm plugging values straight in at the moment as I'm able to transform this
list into XML via that regex find/replace in Sublime. I get as far as the
var_dump above which seems ok but the select box link values don't come into
the section when I import. I am on the normal version so I'll also switch to
integration next and try with that. I have been trying to put the relation_id
in so I'll try with IDs instead. Back later with news :)

Hmmm … it all boils down to »how to import multiple entry-ids into an SBL-
Field via XML-Importer«. Comma-seperated values don’t seem to work. Any ideas
@jonmifsud ? @brendo ?

Neither `<Leitung>9, 13</Leitung>` nor `<Leitung>9,13</Leitung>` imported as
`Leitung/text()` works.

Ok ok … solved it. Importing this way works: XML
`<Leitung><item>9</item><item>13</item></Leitung>` and XPATH
`Leitung/item/text()`.

Still not working for me, only had a short while to play. I'll take another
look later. Same problem as I was having above, the Select doesn't seem to
import when I give the entry_id.

Usually what I used to do was get the XML entires and map them to
$data[‘relation_id’] = array(‘id1’,’id2’) if not mistaken
