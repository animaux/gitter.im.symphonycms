@nitriques just noticed something odd - deployed an app on Amazon using Aurora
as the DB Engine - and all my tables are InnoDB (so far so good) however as
you may know every once in a while the optimize function runs on the cache
table which is creating some funny `locking` scenarios. And as InnoDB does not
exactly do an optimize the same way MyISAM does it may potentially be a
problem. I don’t think I have a lot of data in this table - but it could be
because I stopped all processes so it took a mid-way optimize. Not sure if
anyone encountered this

@nitriques thanks for the good advice about the hostname security. do you have
maybe some references to some articles about the security risks so I can read
further? I've tried to search about this to learn more, but could not find
anything (I think because of my limited english vocabulary), only that folks
were deciding whether to use .local or .localhost or .dev etc. postfixes, but
not why.

@nitriques and about Symphony, if the Symphony version has impact on this
login denial, this I don't know, but a small note: I've encountered this state
only now with Symphony v2.7.x. (I have used the 2.7.x now for the first time
for a project).

@jurajkapsz You can read about the Same-Origin Policy. It applies to lots of
stuff the browser does (line how cookies are shared across requests). So if
the same hostname is used for different servers, it can creates problem
because the only way the browser can tell is via the hostname

____

@jurajkapsz did you had the problem on mutiple installs ?

@nitriques good indeed :) InnoDB is far more usable than MyISAM for certain
use-cases - we can forget about table locking :)

Indeed. I've plan the effort to migrate the more popular extensions. You'll
have an upgrade window with version 3.0.0: the old API still works

____

You can take a look of the core migration:  DeuxHuitHuit/symphonycms@e6c7673

Same here. The goal would be to leverage the core unit test to add your own

extensions should also provide unit tests...

Hi @nitriques. Does the pdo connection allow other options than InnoDB. e.g.
does MariaDB's XML table connection offer Symphony anything useful?

@jonmifsud actually cool

____

@jonmifsud I see the current backend and its functionality as a killer feature

____

@nitriques thanks, I will check out the Same-Origin Policy. And no, I only
encoutered it recently with v2.7.x, as I have used it for the first time for a
project. But I will make some tests again to confirm.

is there a bug with 2.7.5 with textareas? all textareas in the backend are
blank but the data is in them in data sources, datas just not showing in the
latest version for some reason, rolled back to 2.7.4 and textareas work again
