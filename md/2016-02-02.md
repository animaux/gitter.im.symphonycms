And fetchByPage is always ordered ?

Unfortunately, `fetchByPage` doesn't care about ordering:

____

    
    
     $records = self::fetch(null, $section_id, null, null, $where, $joins, $group, $buildentries, $element_names);

____

It just calls `fetch`.

and does no-order default to a sort by ID?

No, it doesn't. It omits the `ORDER BY` clause. Good luck then.

`fetchByPage` doesn't care about the order. So it calls `fetch` without such a
param. `fetch` will either sort by IDs (if `$_fetchSortDirection` is `null`,
which is the default) or it will apply sorting if this param is not `null`.
This happened to me – one of the SBL field's methods (triggered in a callback)
called `setFetchSorting` and thus defined a sorting. Since the EntryManager is
static, well… this sorting was applied.

____

Pretty complicated. And hard to fix without breaking the API.

ah yes; I’ve noticed that once or twice to be honest so I had to change the
sorting when going in/out of the loops. In fact I don’t use the fetchByPage
much i just use fetch and pass the parameters…

No I don’t think but I probably did that the first time then I would re-use
the previous function(s) / work arounds and forget to file issues

Yep, that's what I will do as well. This is what I do now in all similar
scripts:

____

    
    
    EntryManager::setFetchSorting( 'system:id', 'ASC');
    while ($entries = EntryManager::fetchByPage($page, $section_id, $entriesPerPage, $where, null, false, true, true)) {
        if (empty($entries['records'])) {
            break;
        }
        foreach ($entries['records'] as $key => $entry) {
            // do stuff
        }
    
        // Reset EntryManager's fetch sorting, it may have been changed by callbacks
        EntryManager::setFetchSorting('system:id', 'ASC');
    
        $page++;
    }

____

The biggest problem is if you call delegates inside the loop and don 't
oversee what may happen in the callbacks.

true; I guess sorting should technically be something on a per-query basis.
which would be a big drastic api change.

Pretty simple to add it, but we have an existing param `$enable_sort` in
`fetch` method which triggers useless behaviour. That's what I discussed with
@nitriques above.

@michael-e I've read the same post on stack exchange haha

____

> $enable_sort in fetch method which triggers useless behaviour.

That's not true: there are times when I do not care about the ordering and
just want a fast query (ordering takes time)

____

But we need to find a way to make fetchByPage orderable or not (as discussed)

It's hard to do this without removing the `$enable_sort` parameter or changing
its meaning. The only way would be to add another parameter (to both
functions), but this kind of opposes the `$enable_sort` parameter.

@nitriques if you want a page why would you not want to sort?

____

Assuming you want to go from page 1 to page 2 you will need the ‘same’ not
random sort for it to make any sense

if you’re doing a standard ‘fetch’ than you’re right order might not matter
