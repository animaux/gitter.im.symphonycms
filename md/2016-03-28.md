@wdebusschere when did the error happen? Someone trying to save something?

____

It‚Äôs possible that the client pasted characters which are UTF8-mb4 (not
supported by MySQL as UTF8)

Can you make sure there are not special characters? Maybe there‚Äôs an encoded
whitespace character

do i need to solve this in our jquery/customize event

____

or can it be done on symphony level

____

mbstring is enabled

____

is there any site with this kind of characters for testing?

____

DB is CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_unicode_ci;

at the moment Symphony doesn‚Äôt take care of it (though at some point it might)

____

it depends if you want to strip them or just leave them there. But possible to
amend somewhere along the way. If you want to look up a JS based solution it
would be UTF8-mb4. MySQL‚Äôs charset doesn‚Äôt support them as set. To support it
you need a database migration/update + 1 or 2 changes in the symphony core

simulate? I think you‚Äôll have to look up but my guess is most of the
asian/chinese alphabet requuires 4 bytes so they will probably throw the error

would you first need to change the encoding for each individual field's table

____

then make sure the xslt parser to not freeze on it... it 's not an easy task

The XSLT parser? I wouldn't expect problems here. But: You must hack
Symphony's MySQL connection as [explained in a Github
discussion](https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/issues/2315#issuecomment-114156900)

Try whitespace or controls character

____

Caracter that uses 4 bytes long

____

@michael-e i am not sure how well the xslt parser behave with those..

Well... The fact that I wouldn't expect problems does not mean that I wouldn't
find any. :-)
