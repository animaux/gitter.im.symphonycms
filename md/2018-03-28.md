@peterfleck_twitter Not without modifying the extension, I imagine. You can of
course tick the "Can update existing entries" checkbox to avoid duplicate
entries being created, but it's still a manual run. Maybe a cron job would do
it, but I'm not sure if it could be run outside of Symphony without, again,
modifying the extension.
