hello everyone, how's going? need little help here, I replaced the MAMP app by
the default apache+php7+mysql setup in OSX, now when try to install fresh
project I got this

    
    
    ============================================
    INSTALLATION PROCESS STARTED (2016-03-29T04:43:37+02:00)

    ============================================

any suggestions what possibly can be this error? I'll keep investigating, just
posting here in case someone had experienced this before. Thanks in advance
for the attention, I'll post here in case I find a solution.

Odd looks like MySQL config issue

@wdebusschere is the client on Windows or is the server hosted on Windows?

and it’s not something specific to a browser in particular? Guess is content
is submitted in an encoding other than UTF8; which would be a bit odd; I think
quite a few of us have large sites I’m sure if it was a common instance we’d
have it pointed out by now; @michael-e would probably have encountered the
windows specific issue by now.

Adding accept-charset="ISO-8859-1" to the form solved the problem
