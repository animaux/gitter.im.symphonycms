    $ object = whatever is before [;
    $var = $object[…;

basically it doesn’t allow you to take objects and take their array properties

hmm possibly - @nitriques might be able to tell you more. I haven’t used
php5.3 in a good while now. My extensions are all 5.5upwards in terms of
compatibility… but I do backport/make fixes for some devs when asked.

____

If the errors are on the core we might either have to bump up the php version
or modify the impacted files. I know for certain that 3.0 will have a higher
php requirement

yeah it was quite a while back to be fair, it was an overall
direction/strategy discussion because some thought having an alternate
rendering engine could make symphony easier to take up, as it lowers the entry
level and associated learning curve. but there where not sufficient hands on
deck to tackle it properly. But if we have an engine choice between XSLT 1 and
XSLT 2 it could add that possibility in the future.

I don't think Symphony CMS should start using XSLT 2. I may be mistaken, but
it appears that Saxon XSLT is a commercial product, and not available through
Linux package management, so it's not an option in many servers. I was
thinking what if I could swap out implementation of the `XsltProcess` in an
extension. Then it would become an option to use XSLT 2 for whoever has Saxon
installed and desires to use XSLT 2. I could try it out if this idea is even
feasible.

compilation to install, but that may change in the future.

@siimsoni I think that would be the idea. but changing the XsltProcess as
you’re saying would probably need some restructuring/changing of core code. It
would have to be like the ‘cache’ where you have a ‘driver’ and a default
engine. then extensions can provide their own engines

@jonmifsud I see, so it's a sort of dependency injection: there is a cache
class `Cacheable`, and an interface for the storage engines `iCache`
implemented by `CacheDatabase`. The concrete implementation is provided by
`ExtensionManager::getCacheProvider()`. I will hack around with it a bit. :-)

this datasource is pulling data that has a type value (Events, Press Release,
Public Affairs) I need to have the order be asc when the user hits
[domain.com/?type=Event](http://domain.com/?type=Event)#results and the order
to be desc when they hit
[domain.com/?type=Press+Release](http://domain.com/?type=Press+Release)#results.

kiddin, I had a question.

Custom events. being as the old `include(TOOLKIT .
'/events/event.section.php');` file has been deprecated. What file do I need
to include in an events trigger function to retrieve the data from the section
to manipulate before posting.. and in turn returning the $result array and
XML. I find myself having to grab this old file everytime.
