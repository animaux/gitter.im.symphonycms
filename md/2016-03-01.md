`Parse error: syntax error, unexpected '['` is a php version error? I've tried

yeah what you will have to do for every such instance is something like this

__ __

    
    
    $object = whatever is before [;
    $var = $object[…;

__ __

basically it doesn’t allow you to take objects and take their array properties

hmm possibly - @nitriques might be able to tell you more. I haven’t used
php5.3 in a good while now. My extensions are all 5.5upwards in terms of
compatibility… but I do backport/make fixes for some devs when asked.

__ __

If the errors are on the core we might either have to bump up the php version
or modify the impacted files. I know for certain that 3.0 will have a higher
php requirement

um strange.. maybe you need to set it to `$matches = array();`

__ __

I would suggest

__ __

that if your servers are php5.3

__ __

locally you set up the same php version

__ __

even if it means having VM’s with different versions

__ __

as otherwise it iill be impossible to debug

@nitriques You mentioned switching the rendering engine in [this

consideration for usage of some sort of dependency injection or service

I think he’s referring to an old discussion where people where suggesting
different rendering engines not just XSLT to possibly increase uptake.

yeah it was quite a while back to be fair, it was an overall
direction/strategy discussion because some thought having an alternate
rendering engine could make symphony easier to take up, as it lowers the entry
level and associated learning curve. but there where not sufficient hands on
deck to tackle it properly. But if we have an engine choice between XSLT 1 and
XSLT 2 it could add that possibility in the future.

choose.

I don't think Symphony CMS should start using XSLT 2. I may be mistaken, but
it appears that Saxon XSLT is a commercial product, and not available through
Linux package management, so it's not an option in many servers. I was
thinking what if I could swap out implementation of the `XsltProcess` in an
extension. Then it would become an option to use XSLT 2 for whoever has Saxon
installed and desires to use XSLT 2. I could try it out if this idea is even
feasible.

Okay Saxon HE is an open source, and at the current state it seems to require
compilation to install, but that may change in the future.

@siimsoni I think that would be the idea. but changing the XsltProcess as
you’re saying would probably need some restructuring/changing of core code. It
would have to be like the ‘cache’ where you have a ‘driver’ and a default
engine. then extensions can provide their own engines

@jonmifsud I see, so it's a sort of dependency injection: there is a cache
class `Cacheable`, and an interface for the storage engines `iCache`
implemented by `CacheDatabase`. The concrete implementation is provided by
`ExtensionManager::getCacheProvider()`. I will hack around with it a bit. :-)

@nitriques I tried that and got a 500, one thing I should have mentioned is
this datasource is pulling data that has a type value (Events, Press Release,
Public Affairs) I need to have the order be asc when the user hits
[domain.com/?type=Event](http://domain.com/?type=Event)#results and the order
to be desc when they hit
[domain.com/?type=Press+Release](http://domain.com/?type=Press+Release)#results.
does that make a difference?

kiddin, I had a question.

Custom events. being as the old `include(TOOLKIT .
'/events/event.section.php');` file has been deprecated. What file do I need
to include in an events trigger function to retrieve the data from the section
to manipulate before posting.. and in turn returning the $result array and
XML. I find myself having to grab this old file everytime.

But I would say this: Create your own class, inheriting from SectionEvent
(class.event.section.php)

__ __

no I code my own ;)

Haha. ninja

So my class extends SectionEvent like a normal event would?

normally yes

__ __

create a intermediary between the two if you want

__ __

or you could hijack your own __doIt method in the event's php file

__ __

You could also listen for the 'EventPostSaveFilter' delegate from a custom
extension

__ __

you get the whole entry object in that delegate

__ __

Also: would you please test if you can login on the
<http://symphonyextensions.com/> website please ? :P

I was going to offer if you wanted me to test. Sure thing.. on it.

It does the redirect to github right, but when it returns to the symextensions
site, It goes to my profile page, but I'm not loggedin and can't add ant repos
or anything.

__ __

*any repos

Let me know if you want me to try again @nitriques I'm guessing I'll need to
revoke access using oAuth from github to test again.
