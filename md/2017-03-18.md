sorry @jonmifsud I wasn't meaning your method. I meant it seems like it should
be built into Symphony

Ah well that’s usually built within the Datasource; I think the logic as-is
works. In the sense that you’ll want to give the developer full flexibility on
what to include in the entry XML; though if we really had to spend some time
working on the API there are a few tweaks like this we could do.
