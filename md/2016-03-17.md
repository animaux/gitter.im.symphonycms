I have a quick question if I may. How does symphony handles bit bigger data
sources. I'm talking about section that would have about 70 000 entries with
at least 12 fields per entry.

@Creepjack are you planning on paginating through it or not?

because that would make a big difference

I wouldn’t really recommend it; 70,000 entries is quite a lot of XML / XSLT
Processing. If you really need to I’d suggest pairing it with some kind of
caching unless you have new entries being created all the time.

____

What I recall from past experience trying to generate a sitemap with 60,000
entries all in one go, used to take a while. I ended up generating a sitemap
file for each category on the site to avoid loading up 60,000 entries.

@nitriques is planning to try release Symphony 3.0 over the summer. Depending
on some factors but hopefully should go through. are you asking in regards to
a particular feature?

I'm "hovering" around some bigger project and I'm wondering if sym will have
continued support and how much new version will break compatibility with
current extensions. Is sym3 a "revolution" or just an upgrade?

So there will be Sym 2.7.0 which will be an LTS version. so it should be
fairly stable in the long term we’re currenty in the process of making that
PHP7 compatible.

Sym 3.0 might have some breaking changes, but most likely there will be an
upgrade path not a complete revolution. It would probably depend on what
extensions you use, and who is supporting them. If they’re core extensions, or
mantained by active members they will be upgraded.

[These are a few key
items](https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=milestone%3A3.0.0+).
some are already on ‘integration’ branch others still need to be worked on.
Probably the biggest change is PDO

Apparently the `remove` button is not shown on single selects. Which I always
found was a problem in the current `association_ui_selector` implementation.
Since you have to use backspace to remove a single entry, which is pretty
unintuitive.

____

Looks like this is not `association_ui_selector`-behaviour, but selectize’s.

go for a PR against 2.7.x (unless he was looking at an overall update)

sorry to go in the middle of the conversation, just a quick update in case
someone is interested: I started a Symphony CMS as data API provider for
React.js client app here <https://github.com/bernardodiasc/symapi>, just
started so it's very simple, very basic as intended to be a proof of concept.

another proof of concept is this <https://github.com/bernardodiasc/hsfcms> \--
I'll make the schema look like the symphony one, so possible use the same
react client for both CMS - symphony and the static file, this second based on
jeckyll experiences.

It’s kind of the replacement for the ol’ Subsectionmanager.

____

A bit more complex to set up, but more flexible.

no it is like the old subsectionmanager or better selectboxlink. Thus to link
entries together. Like a category for a product or in this example to link an
image from a image section

You can use it for anything. I always have a section called `images` which is
an image file and a titel. Then you can use the association-suite to link
these images to pages, persons or whatever data you have. Be it as image-
galleries, page-header, peoples-portraits, whatever you like.

____

Same goes for dowloads/documents

So I simply replace …/lib/selectize.js with the current version and run grunt
js

____

_This message was deleted_

____

and that will create a new symphony.js?

____

pardon, `symphony.min.js`

____

apparently

____

my first grunt!

Hmn ok. I cut out the selectize-part of the newly created `symphony.min.js`
which resulted in a working file. BUT the reason for using a newer version, e.
g. having a remove-button for a single-entry association did not work. Hmm.
Must be somewhere else.

the single entry doesn't have a `<a href="javascript:void(0)"
class="destructor" tabindex="-1" title="Remove">Remove</a>` as far as I can
see

Yes, but that’s apparently created by selectize.js, not the
`association_ui_selector`.

____

The selectize remove plugin is loaded either way.

____

And triggered.

____

Will have to take another look later or ask Nils :·)
