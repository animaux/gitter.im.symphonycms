I don’t use publish tabs, at least not yet, but seems reasonable. Though not
sure what’s the usefulness of hide for all? It would hide for devs too?. I
would go for hide for authors and hide for authors/managers (non dev)

@jonmifsud sorry for late reply, I've messed with several off-the-shelf ecom
like actinic, magento, opencart they're annoying compared to symphony but have
lots of features that might take a long time to replicate in Symphony. They
are all bloated and magento the most but it has the most versatile products
out-of-the-box. With your PHP skill all of them would be easy for you.

So you just make Symphony output the "data-item-...." and snipcart does the
rest?
