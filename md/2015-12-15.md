I think the bundle extensions are missing from this download zip, or did they
not get put in anymore? <http://www.getsymphony.com/download/>

Please can I have a list of the things I 'd need to do to make Git clone Sym
and the default extensions? My skill level so far is at: git clone
<https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2.git> myfoldername

I found it by scrolling down the instructions on the Git page :facepalm

That was easy when I tried :)

@DavidOliver yes thanks, worked first time when I tried today. Previously I'd
just got empty folders for each extension. All good now though.
