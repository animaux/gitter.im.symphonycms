@brendo @nilshoerrmann tried to convince me to do some backend css work which
I started, but …

____

Which would be interesting to have for 2.7.0

____

But it still needs quite a lot of love plus community feedback. Plus I’m on
paternity leave okt/nov. So I guess it’s rather later.

Hi, does somebody has already a custom datasource that makes a datasource from
all the image files in a specific directory?

@moretaste not recommended if this is an ‘uploads’ folder

____

had used an ‘old’ upload field which did just that

____

and it constantly crashes

____

or takes way too long to load

What I would suggest that you do… is a “Section” which is for uploads

____

and link that uploads to whatever you want and you can search the
database/filenames like that

But that way the client has to make 160-320 entries. I think I will make an
xslt template and some strict naming for the images

____

<http://symphonyextensions.com/extensions/multiuploadfield/> is for one entry
I think. And not as the old mass upload extension that makes an entry for each
file?
