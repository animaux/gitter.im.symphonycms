First of all that doesn’t look like Symphony CMS unless you’re doing something
completely custom. Secondly; you would need to make sure that you have an
index on product_name. If you have a lot of entries that would hurt your
performance significantly

I am thinking Symfony which is something else not the CMS that we support here

You probably don't need to be doing SELECT * either

Is there something like this: <https://github.com/symphonycms/members/wiki

@moretaste, I am afraid that there is nothing like that for the Symphony core.
All I have done a long time ago is a schematic presentation of the page
creation process (frontend) including the delegates. (I am not sure if it is
still upto date, however.)

@moretaste I don’t know if I had something running around but I do recall
making a sketch at some point for my thesis.. but it’s probably much less
detailed I’ll look it up

Mine is a bit more detailed, I needed it for my "big system" in order to know
which delegates I could use to manipulate the frontend.

I removed the right side of the drawing (which shows the custom extensions
plugging into the delegates) — most of these delegates are actually used!

I like @jonmifsud's nevertheless, because it explains what XML/XSLT is for.
You don't find that in my drawing. :-)

Hi vdcrea!

__ __

We need help from non devs! Are you able to install it and test ?

__ __

Install a bunch of extension and test, add documentation, propose changes ;)

__ __

the best place for this is github

__ __

you can check for the "test needed" issues

I feel I can be more efficient on the front end side of symphony's websites,
if you need css, js. I know it s not skills needed for the core dev but I ll
be happy to help
