@josealbertorodriguesjunior that used to be possible via drag & drop with
subsectionmanager in the old days … there are some other solutions/suggestions
in the forum:

@wdebusschere there are also nice text functions like »Prefix/Suffix lines«,
or »process lines containing …« in BBEdit.

I’m currently writing a Media Library extension, which I was thinking of
integrating with the tinyMCE editor. It’d provide a platform to upload an
image, or select one from the Uploads directory.

Still in development though sorry

To our german speaking developer: How are you dealing with the german
salutation "du" in websites and emails? Always in lowercases or with a leading
uppercase?  
Two examples:  
In Twitter emails and notifications the "du" is always with a leading
uppercase.  
In WordPress emails and notifications is "du" \- as long as not at the
beginning of sentences - always small.  
And thats what the Duden recommend:
