@wdebusschere I doubt that makes much sense...

____

I would trash cachelite - use Datasource Caching instead and then use
something like varnish/nginx on the frontent to cache anything without cookies

Thanks both. Looking forward to 2.7. Should we expect a period of extension
incompatibility while extension developers catch up with 2.7? We have a
release late June which I'd love to release on 2.7 if possible.

@jonmifsud datasource caching is not so fast like cachelite in our cases, +
you need to select the datasources, + no ideao how to to varnish/nginx..

@wdebusschere yes and no - it’s nearly as fast. cachelite is for static pages;
clearly your use-case is not static.

we dont need caching in the frontendcms, just for the public pages, which
don't change often

not sure but your best bet would be to set paths for exclusion; not linking it
to members extension

not familar enough with cache lite to suggest what needs to be changed though

@wdebusschere I have never used CacheLite, instead I follow the same route as
@jonmifsud (using nginx as proxy server). Regarding the `CacheliteBypass`
delegate: Yes, of course, one might add a function in Members that subscribes
to the delegate. BTW, the Members extension has been created by @brendo!

Googling won't help much. It's better to read code and comments. First, look
for examples (in other extensions).

you could ask your hosting company to help you out that’s your best bet if you
don’t have the knowledge

well you need to configure it otherwise it’s pointless; but that’s your
homework + working with your host

Hmm… Anyone got any ideas why `$field->get('element_name')`,  
`$field->get('label')`, and `$field->get('id')` in
`contentPublish::createFieldFilters()` in the `2.7.x.beta2` branch would be
returning `null`, even though the requested fields have values in the
`_fields` property of the `Field` class?
