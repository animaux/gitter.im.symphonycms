@nitriques do you have or know of some Snipcart extensions for Symphony? Looks
like we'll be using it for a project if a client approves the proposal. Just
wondering what's out there.

@pixelninja the only code I needed to create for my workflow was a custom
event in order to handle webhooks. If not, it is only data-attributes and some
js

____

I could share the php event if you need webhooks

I also started to work on integrated dashboard panels.. but this is really wip
