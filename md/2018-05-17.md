Yup sessions are not being writted in 7.0.30

____

If I save the session with 7.1.17, then login, then switch to 7.0.30 IT WORKS
! haha

____

The cookie value remains consistant, but a new session is created each time

yeah its about writing the session. I could make it work if I restarted the
session before we close. somewhere php 7.0.30 must be thinking that there is
no longer an open session. once i got that to write then it works

The problem (from what I can see is that PHP returns `1` for
`session_status()` when in the `write` session callback

____

This makes session_decode fail

____

Looks like a PHP bug to me. 5.6 and 7.1 both returns `2` (active)

____

The problem is that 7.0 is unusable for Symphony :(

____

Or: we created empty sessions in the database, which used to make 7.0 work

____

Or: check for `sym-|a:0:{}`
