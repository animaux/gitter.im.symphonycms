@michael-e, sorting is working properly now, for whatever reason. I guess it
was a combination of both opcache's not checking modified times and file
permissions.

@brendo the union datasource is escaping html from formatted text. Is that by
purpose or a bug? I have to use the ninja technique on those nodes but due to
the escape, that won't work.

Or is there another way to unescape the nodes first before apply-ing the ninja
template?

@brendo just need to check something - Should the `SymphonyErrorPageHandler`
render function always run `Page::renderStatusCode($e->getHttpStatusCode());`
? At the moment if there is a custom error template it does not throw a 500
error but a 200.

also is it possible to catch fatal errors? to show a user friendly error page?
not sure what the difference is with the user error templates or if there is a
particular distinction.

I can't have a page name that's the same as a workspace folder name or 403
forbidden?
