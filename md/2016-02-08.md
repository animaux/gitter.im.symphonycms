Can you use cachelite on pages that contain symphony event forms? I can't
remember if it's an issue or not.

@nitriques \- it looks as if a variable, `$new_url` is not defined in the
template of the [symphonyextensions.com](http://symphonyextensions.com) site.
That's why you are getting the error... looks like you need to just define a
global parameter called `new_url` and it should suppress that error.

Dear folks, I’m having a date-filter problem again. Filtering by `later than
last day of this month + equal to or earlier than last day of next month` does
not show the 31. of March while it should, shouldn’tit? Is this a PHP bug
possibly? Could not find a similar problem in the forum :(

____

All I want to achieve is to get all the days in the next month. Which should
be simple. BUT. I’m having a very hard time trying to find the right
expression :sparkles:

the +2 offset that’s a local time setting

____

php would translate that to your local time anyway - the problem is that by
default in php a day is/starts at midnight so you will have to define that
23:59 at the end I’m afraid

Hi

____

depends what you are comparing it to

____

if you take wordpress - consider wordpress a standard 3 bedroom apartment -
where you can paint it anyway you like but to add an extra room you need to
pretty much change a whole apartment and/or purchase the one next door…

____

and Symphony is pretty much like buying a plot of land, and a bunch of
building blocks/bricks. Thus you can build apartments, a house, a villa or a
castle, it’s pretty much up to you.

We have custom ‘data-sources’ which connect via curl etc to the third party
sources, and or our databases’ custom tables. That data is then converted to
XML, and symphony with the help of XSLT templates converts into the web page

if you want to use symphony you’ll need to at the very least have pre-
knowledge of HTML/CSS etc - XSLT is something you can learn. But no other
database such as SQL is required.

____

that’s possible with any system, but there are different technologies at play.

____

the simplest is ‘ajax’ where using javascript you send a request to the server

Then the next level would be ‘push’ notifications for that to run there are
some new server technologies symphony by default doesn’t use any of those but
it’s possible to get whatever generates your push request to take data from
symphony.

____

when you type ‘on google’ what it does is AJAX, there is a listen event on the
text box and asks google with every key stroke to get new data

____

you need to research more on Javascript to understand what you can do

the issue I have is really weird… I’m sure I tested this on another page and
had no issues.. but outputing position() is causing this weird xslt context
error

never mind...

____

<xsl:number> does the trick instead...

____

but I don’t recall ever having a problem doing `<xsl:value-of
select=‘position()’/>`

Xsl:number without parameters gives the same value of position so it solved my
issue

Needed it in a ninja technique to do some fancy inline comments

> if you take wordpress - consider wordpress a standard 3 bedroom apartment -
where you can paint it anyway you like but to add an extra room you need to
pretty much change a whole apartment and/or purchase the one next door…  
> and Symphony is pretty much like buying a plot of land, and a bunch of
building blocks/bricks. Thus you can build apartments, a house, a villa or a
castle, it’s pretty much up to you.

Love that comparison
