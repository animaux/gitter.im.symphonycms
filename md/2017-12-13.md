And the `@id` which you can use to filter a DS then.

____

If you store IDs in storage, that is.

I see.

In my case your `[year]`-part is the ID which I can use to filter a DS.

I will have to customize the extension a bit

____

not only outputting array_keys but also the values

So you don 't filter by id's or titles

____

just by some predefined filters?

Yes, by IDs. But I don’t need your second value for filtering.

____

I store IDs + a count number

The count number is not present in the params.

____

I retrieve that from the regular xml output

@wdebusschere The Cookie Monster extension could work for that:
<https://github.com/symphonists/cookiemonster> \- we have it working with a
Symphony 2.7 site. I think (amazingly) that the extension works out of the
box.

I always thought `storage` was the successor to the good old cookie monster,
but maybe the approach is different. @nilshoerrmann would know `:)`
