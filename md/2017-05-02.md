will let you know how I end up proceeding; we need some adjustments on the
index code you picked up on.

@nitriques Thx. But unfortunately that article doesn't "work" for 2.5 and
above due to changes in events. Was just curious if there was updated version
or example of how should new custom event look like. I "just" need to add
multiple entries to section2 while creating one entry in section1. Have
problem with proper "field" addressing in section1 event definition (
something like $_POST['fields']['field-name'][0] = value - doesn't seem to
work).

@jonmifsud @nitriques So.. I have something like this:  
protected function __trigger() {

    
    
        $result = new XMLElement('ev-section1');
        $result = $this->execute();//running section1 event
    
        //getting values for section2
        $val1 = $_POST['fields']['section1-field1'];
        $val2 = $_POST['fields']['section1-field2'];
    
        //creating section2 entry and launching the event
        $_POST['fields']['section2-field1'] = $result->getAttribute('id');
        $_POST['fields']['section2-field2'] = $val1;
        $_POST['fields']['section2-field3'] = $val2;
        $_POST['action']['ev-section2'] = 'Submit';
    
        return $result;
    }

And it works for one entry. BUT what if I want to create multiple entries in
section2 while creating only one entry in section1? How do I define those
extra fields in $_POST for addtional entries?

Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.
