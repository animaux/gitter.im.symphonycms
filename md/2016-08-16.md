@michael-e Quick question for when you’re around. (or anyone else with a good
email background/history) How do you deal with the `<!--[if mso | IE]` stuff?
xsl comment and encode all the `<` and `>` within each block?

I never used conditional comments in emails. But I used all of these
(downlevel-hidden, downlevel-revealed) in my XSLT-generated HTML pages. Is
there any difference in emails? (If it's the same, I can tell you more.)

Yes I think it’s the same; just for outlook

been a while since I had to support IE6 and haven’t built new html emails to
use in ETM for a while

I create the "standard" (downlevel-hidden) conditional comment like so:

____

    
    
     <xsl:comment><![CDATA[[if lt IE 10]>Content for IE<![endif]]]></xsl:comment>

and the CDATA wouldn’t effect anything with the output? (wasn’t quite sure so
I stalled at that point)

No, for XSLT there's simply "some CDATA stuff". It works perfectly.
