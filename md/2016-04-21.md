If you want to setup Subresource Integrity, it's the simpliest way ;)

ah nice! :)

__ __

so bye bye versioning? :)

__ __

there was another extension which did something similar.

__ __

also had issues with a few clients (same thing happening on backend /
extensions) I don’t think we have JS/CSS versioning practices going something
like this for backend would also solve any issues with js/css updates from
core/extensions

I would still use versioning with this. It's really to protect your site
against CDN based XSS

ah CDN I haven’t gone into yet. was a trial with someone who was resistant and
never happened.. but might need to play around at some point in near future

checkout Cloudflare

we’re going to shift the largest client to AWS, a separate sys-admin for htem
is doing it, so that would mean we probably go with the Amazon CDN, CloudFront
I believe. - most other clients are fairly small right now

__ __

whilst a free plan would work it’s an extra step :)

yes Cloudfront works well

__ __

you can'T use the naked domain tho (since Amazon does not supports CNAME at
the root level)

I'm not sure. I'm translating Symphony language file from english to croatian.
Actually source is english, and translation is German, but I'm translating to
croatian instead.

I'm also not sure what mean "carriage return" in this case:  
Reply-To Email Address can not contain carriage return

@nitriques RE: <https://github.com/DeuxHuitHuit/sri>, check out
<http://au2.php.net/manual/en/function.hash-file.php>, might be a little more

@diomed A carriage return is a newline character. A typewriter has a
'carriage', the part that moves the paper as the typist types.
