Can `grab()` simply be replaced with `execute()` in all datasources without
any further adjustments?

I’ve another problem with your `related: regexp:` association mod,  @jonmifsud

It leaves out all the entries that dont have any set associations in that
field, even if `$ort` is empty.

If `$ort` is empty, the regexp is probably broken. I might be able to solve
this if I use a dedicated DS for this particular filtering mode. Its just not
very elegant `;)`

ah if ort is empty it still runs the regexp on the join I believe. (so if
there are no associations doesn’t quite work. Maybe we can look at something
related or empty…

Would it be possible to make a filter only apply on a Specific `$current-page`
in a custom-DS?

@animaux yes possible. you would have to manipulate the execute function. and
remove the filter when the current-page variable is not what you expect it to.

inject something into `$dsParamFILTERS` if …

outside of execute I believe there’s another function you can do that in; but
it may add complexity usually I stick to the execute to keep things simple

Is it neccessary to add the current-page param to the filters array in order
to have it as a variable in the execute function? Can I not access it directly
inside the execute function?

lets say I find it the easiest/most understandable way especially when I have
to explain it to someone else. But you can probably get that through other
means.

Is anyone else encountering issues with fresh installs of Sym 2.7.6 on Ubuntu
16? We are still getting "cross-site request forgery token". We have the
problem on three different servers now and I am wondering if it could be a bug
in 2.7.6. We're currently testing 2.7.4 to see if that works on the affected
servers

something on the servers!

@nitriques I’m checking something for Stuart… and this looks particularly odd…
Just after the login function runs… (actually inside it) in
<https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/blob/master/symphony/lib/core/class.symphony.php#L465>
I am trying to close the session with `session_write_close();` and it says
`Session is not active` as there is no Data in the session. Doesn’t seem to
make sense to me… The stuff inside cookies (username/password) should be
stored within the open session no?
