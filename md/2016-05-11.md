hmm I’m actually using them jointly because I need to set conditions for
filters.

____

I guess no ‘conditions’ would also mean you could filter as it would always
return true?

____

I certainly need the combo though; so not sure what we’d gain with a split

Ok, but then it there should be the possibility to have an always-true
condition. `if 1=1`

yep you’re right. Before I had the ‘default’ filtering component built into
the core but it was not very clean/neat. It’s a matter of getting the right UI
for this I believe

So there really is no way currently to make filters apply unconditionally?

I can double check; if not we can bake it in

____

I’m thinking it might take the shape of a ‘default’ block

I was not able to make it work yesterday, but that may be because of this.

The `condition` is applied to a field in the section the `association_field`
is in? Or is it applied to a field inside the associated content?

____

Thanks!

Don’f forget my pull request regarding the UI-Redesign :·)

____

The interface for filtering could simply be something like this quick mockup.

____

Could work the same way for conditions I guess.

____

The hide/show fields stuff would need some more magic though.

____

A bit like the index filtering, where you can add further options for
hiding/showing fields.

____

Would be a rather complex form :/

yeah I have a concept somewhere I can see if I can find it.. but yeah it could
get fairly complex

The interface could be a bit like the one for smart groups in Lightroom or
smart playlists in iTunes, where you can stack several options.

____

Or conditions.

I’ll be off for today, see’ya!
