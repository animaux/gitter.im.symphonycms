We should rename `Symphony CMS` to `Not Symfony Framework but Symphony CMS`

____

@andrewminton I gave `entry_versions` a quick try. Looking good so far. Just
noticed you flipped month and day in the version info. You are not american,
are you? :D

____

And it’s much easier to use than I thought too. Plain simple, nice.

I think simply Symphony CMS - with a small note PS. make sure you can spell
properly. should do the trick

guys.. and gals.. is there a translation feature for error messaging within
forms at all?

____

I 've had a requirement to produce an event registration form and I need all
the error messages to be translated as well. If we used the Symphony language
pack approach, would it also effect the language for the front end events as
well?

Yes I believe if your fl language is set properly all error messages for
frontend are fed in the right language.

What about switching between those 2 FL langs on the frontend? language
redirect et al arent connected in that way to the backend instruction are
they?

points to valid lines!

one small suggestion (maybe)

____

do you think there should be a ‘canonical’ link or some other link to the
‘latest’ version. google at times gives the old versions.
