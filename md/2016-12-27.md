@michael-e Following the recent security issue on PHPMailer (and projects
which use it incl WordPress) I was pretty happy to tell clients that the
issue/exploit is not on the Symphony Core :) [at least thatâ€™s what walking
through the details / code seemed to determine]

Yep, we don't use PHP Mailer (or even parts of it) in Symphony. Nevertheless I
would welcome experienced programmers resp. hackers performing audits on the
email core and the email extensions alike.

I went back to the original mail function exploit, and I think we are fine too
but same as you if someone did an audit it would be more than welcome. also
@michael-e thanks for your hard work on the email stuff I know you where
heavily involved

Thanks! Indeed I spent a lot of time on it, but @creativedutchmen did nearly
all of the coding work.
