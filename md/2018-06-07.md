@michael-e I now use Gitlab for all my projects. I really like it.

Interesting! Could the free, self-hosted version be an option for symphony?

@animaux I think the question would be do we want to self-host it… my guess
would be extra admin burden which we’d rather spend the time working to
improve things. Also the potential benefit of github is exposure. I think
dealing on private/vs public repos is different. Github still looks to me as
the home of open source… Bitbucket does free open source repos as far as I
know but it’s never taken off…

Good point. Free repos are also available at Gitlab, not sure if they offer
the same functionality as in Github today. MS-Github needs to be kept an eye
on.

quick question: anyone could point me in a direction where I can see examples
of automated symphony installations (no need for user's input - default
values)?

@animaux I tested moving a GitHub repo (including issues) to GitLab, and it
worked like a charme. (It's private on GitLab, however, since I don't want to
confuse anybody.)

Nice! Can you have private repos in the free version?

____

Is there an howto somewhere? I didn’t find any in a quick search.

You can even have unlimited private repos in the free version. It's just some
features that are added if you go for a paid plan. However, I still don't
fully understand what is meant by a "user" in paid plans.

____

You don 't need a how-to to move a GitHub repo. Just click on "New project",
then "Import project". After choosing GitHub, you will have to provide GitHub
permissions. I chose the "Access Token" alternative, because I knew that I can
simply remove the token from my GitHub account afterwards. (Permissions are
read and write, so I wanted to be extra-careful.)

Remember that even with an access token, GitLab will temporarily have full
access to all repos from your personal account and your GitHub groups! So
remove the token if you don't need it any longer.

____

I never bothered to look for github-alternative until now. There are more
actially, f. e. <https://gitea.io/en-US/> (seen in the Gitlab importer : )

But that's a self hosted service. GitLab is both, whatever you like.

Yep. But it seems that today only _Those Stupid Germans <sup>TM</sup>_ are
discussing the move away from _Microsoft GitHub_.

Would be quite a hassle to move the whole economic symphony system to gitlab.

@Creepjack There is a unattend file you can put into the manifest folder
<https://github.com/DeuxHuitHuit/symphonycms/blob/2.7.x/install/includes/unattend.php>

____

This will fill everything up and it should install
