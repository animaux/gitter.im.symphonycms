@cs_php_testing_twitter impossible to answer without knowing what your pages
and datasources look like. Basically you would need to change the url-params
for the assumed `trueline` page or if it’s not a page the root page. You might
break other urls/pages this way though since it looks like the `/product/`
part has been explicitly set up this way to trigger a different
page/datasource.

@cs_php_testing_twitter in order to keep your setup you could also use the
<http://symphonyextensions.com/extensions/url_router/> to route that specific
url to the existing one.

__ __

E. g. route from `/\/(trueline)\/(.*?)\/$/i`  
to `/$1/product/$2/` and change the template urls respectively. (not sure this
regexp is working, but you should get the idea)

thx "animaux" for the quick reply, actually i m new to symphony. I need to
change the meta title of the single product page i.e  
i have used : url handle as "product" and url parameter as "name". i just wnat
to remove this /product/ from the url

__ __

okay, url_router is the extension used in symphony. Can i change the url of
all single product pages using this extention?

You can pretty much route everything to everywhere with this extension which
makes it very powerful but as with everything powerful you should also be very
careful not to accidently redirect stuff you don’t want redirected/routed.

If `product` is a page, the `url_router` is the most straight-forward way I
guess.

__ __

The regexp I have used above should work for everything that starts with
`trueline`

__ __

It only assumes this as a given and forwards the product name, whatever it is,
to the product page. (if it actually _is_ a page)

If you’re new to symphony I strongly recommend to read about the pages/url-
schemes concept first. It’s really hard to say what you have at hand since
there is and endless number of different ways to handle stuff. I assumed you
were working on a page someone else set up.

Looking at the page I don’t feel getting rid of the `/product/`-bit in the url
is a good idea. It perfectly makes sense the way it is set up.

I’d try to convince them the URL makes sense, but I know how clients can be …

I think the Router would be the way to go. You just need to make sure it
doesn’t interfere with other valid urls.

Are the other urls like `/trueline/projects/` and `/trueline/locations/`pages?

__ __

You’re welcome

__ __

Ah hang on. trueline is the root path for this page on your dev server

__ __

Another way to go could be to have the `product`-page as page-type `index` and
integrate the current start-page in it’s template in order to be called when
there’s no product url-param.

__ __

But might be a bit messy.

Yes /trueline. is the root path

i think i need make alot of changes

in the templates

if i use product page as page type index then i need to use the whole code in

what you can do with url-router is set up a regex to take a url to the
symphony page you want.

__ __

so if you cannot distinguish with a regex, the difference between an article
and a product it will be difficult. if you products are ‘fixed’ you can
include them as part of the regex

> @nilshoerrmann but as an usecase do you have clients that do a lot of there
content on a mobile device?

@moretaste: Yes, we do. One of our clients manages the website of a film
festival on mobile to a large extent. They have 369 members, 556 movies and
about 900 social media entries that are imported and handled using Symphony.
Members use the site during the festival when they are on the road: most of
them use their smart phones or tablets in this case.

Due to the complexity of the backend tables, the festival management is
handled via a custom front-end interface though.

The organisers of the festival are students in their early 20s. I’ve watched
them using the site and admin interface and noticed quickly that they are used
to different interaction models than we older ones (I’m 35): it’s all touch,
interfaces animate from one state to another, it’s normal to do 5 things at
once. It’s not an addition for them, it how it’s always been.

@cs_php_testing_twitter I’d recommend using `url_router` instead of messing
with the .htaccess file directly. But if you feel comfortable with it you can
of course do so :·)

@animaux I still wouldn’t say we are old, but we are old enough to no longer
consider ourselves young ;)

Douglas Adams: »I've come up with a set of rules that describe our reactions
to technologies:

  1. Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.
  2. Anything that's invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.
  3. Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.«

Still we have stuff they don’t understand. Hmm. Let’s see: Tape-recorders,
analogue photography, phones with wire …

Though some of the hipsters start to explore those.

Hmmn, simply using `Roboto` in the backend does make it suddenly feel a lot
more contemporary. Damn trends!

I think not being able to quickly find a table row is more of an indictment of
the search/filtering interface than of tables. If there's a plethora of
content wherein the user needs to find something specific, the form factor of
the content only goes so far. That was definitely the case for the
journos/editors at my news company; 5000+ articles, 1000+ contributors, 10k+
media assets, all needing to be interacted with on mobile at some point in the
editorial pipeline

+1 I have a client with around 100,000 articles so search becomes more
important at that point. Though I don’t know / think they really use it from
mobile devices
