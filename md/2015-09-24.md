Can't get it to work, but that is maybe my lack of knowledge how custom events
works :-)

My selectbox got [] so it is an array: `<select name="straatnaam[]"
multiple="multiple" ...`

____

`allowEditorToParse` false and `public function load(){ return
$this->__trigger(); }`

____

I can var_dump the _GET values but it doesnt change the url-param in the debug

ah sorry missed that - yeah it just makes it usable in symphonyâ€¦ if you are
using get an [] will always give you an array.

____

the other way would be to get JS to make that into a comma separated string
before submission

np, it works for now and I'm just doing some test to make a prototype. Maybe I
need already js to limit output of some selectboxes based on the value of
another selectbox

also would using post instead of get be an issue? that would hide the urls
