Some css files are getting a "Not Found"

____

Found  
`http://192.168.99.100/workspace/assets/css/boilerplate_24_4_2016_12_35_28.css`

Not found  
`http://192.168.99.100/workspace/assets/css/boilerplate_24_4_2016_12_41_30.css`

____

Both files are actually present -- assuming theres an htaccess rule that has
run amuck, because the latter then attempts as a directory

____

`http://192.168.99.100/workspace/assets/css/boilerplate_24_4_2016_12_41_30.css/`

____

Looks like it has something to do with the workspace path start

____

`http://192.168.99.100/assets/css/boilerplate_24_4_2016_12_41_30.css` is okay
