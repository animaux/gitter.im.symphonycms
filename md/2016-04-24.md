Some css files are getting a "Not Found"

__ __

Found  
`http://192.168.99.100/workspace/assets/css/boilerplate_24_4_2016_12_35_28.css`

Not found  
`http://192.168.99.100/workspace/assets/css/boilerplate_24_4_2016_12_41_30.css`

__ __

Both files are actually present -- assuming theres an htaccess rule that has
run amuck, because the latter then attempts as a directory

__ __

`http://192.168.99.100/workspace/assets/css/boilerplate_24_4_2016_12_41_30.css/`

__ __

Looks like it has something to do with the workspace path start

__ __

`http://192.168.99.100/assets/css/boilerplate_24_4_2016_12_41_30.css` is okay

Now getting the same with
`http://192.168.99.100/assets/fonts/ionicons/ionicons.ttf/`

__ __

Cannot seem to repair this one

__ __

`http://192.168.99.100/assets/fonts/ionicons/ionicons.svg` is ok
