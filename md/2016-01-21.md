Is it possible to DS filter date field for dates in the next 6 months? - What
would you write in the filter? The things mentioned in "Relative" at the end
of this page doesn't seem to
work.<https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/wiki/DateField>

You should be able to. You can most certainly use ' a to b ' to determine a
date range. Then if I'm not mistaken it supports what might go in strtotime
but haven't got the code in front of me

The bit I can't get to work is something like now to now + 6 months as I need
it to be 6 months from any month it happens to be at the time. It's awkward in
xpath because something like < $this-month + 6 will fetch part of the next
year

____

In field.date.php it just has...

         public function fetchFilterableOperators()
    {
        return array(

don’t mind that always use is when using a range

____

maybe you can try `{$today} to {$today} + six months`

____

not quite sure if the latter part would work but I’m sure there’s a way around
it

____

I think there’s a PR/ticket open to explain the `to` functionality.

Ah, that one doesn't work but {$today} to 2016-07-21 does. I think it's the
part where you write + something at the end. That old docs page has a numeral
"6". I don't think it recognizes the last part "\+ six months" or "\+ 6
months". Maybe you have to include the year as well which would lead to the
same trouble as doing it in the xpath.

according to the comments/docs

____

DateTime is much the same as `strtotime` and will handle relative

____

it also does a + 1 second at the end

____

so “your string + 1 second”

____

if you do `{$today} to + 6 months` it might work

though, it was that space that messed me up the whole time. I've tried these

That's good, I've always just cloned things locally as I thought I'd need a
pro account or something. Didn't want to spend on it until I was doing
something that needed it.

usually it works like this: you clone locally if doing no changes

____

if you need to do changes you `fork` the project

____

push changes to a new branch on your fork.

____

then through the github ui you submit a pull-request

Wow. And I used to think that my "500-websites-from-a-single-install" project
