Is it possible to DS filter date field for dates in the next 6 months? - What
would you write in the filter? The things mentioned in "Relative" at the end
of this page doesn't seem to
work.<https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/wiki/DateField>

You should be able to. You can most certainly use ' a to b ' to determine a
date range. Then if I'm not mistaken it supports what might go in strtotime
but haven't got the code in front of me

The bit I can't get to work is something like now to now + 6 months as I need
it to be 6 months from any month it happens to be at the time. It's awkward in
xpath because something like &lt; $this-month + 6 will fetch part of the next
year

__ __

In field.date.php it just has...

        public function fetchFilterableOperators()
    {
        return array(
            array(

            ),
            array(
                'title' => 'contains',
                'filter' => 'regexp: ',
                'help' => __('Find values that match the given <a href="%s">MySQL regular expressions</a>.', array(

don’t mind that always use is when using a range

__ __

maybe you can try `{$today} to {$today} + six months`

__ __

not quite sure if the latter part would work but I’m sure there’s a way around
it

__ __

I think there’s a PR/ticket open to explain the `to` functionality.

Ah, that one doesn't work but {$today} to 2016-07-21 does. I think it's the
part where you write + something at the end. That old docs page has a numeral
"6". I don't think it recognizes the last part "\+ six months" or "\+ 6
months". Maybe you have to include the year as well which would lead to the
same trouble as doing it in the xpath.

according to the comments/docs

__ __

DateTime is much the same as `strtotime` and will handle relative

__ __

it also does a + 1 second at the end

__ __

so “your string + 1 second”

__ __

if you do `{$today} to + 6 months` it might work

__ __

if I follow the logic

Nearly, it has to be just like this:

    earlier than {$today} +6 months

Oh, wait I want anything from ideally this month to in six months time. NP
though, it was that space that messed me up the whole time. I've tried these
similar combinations but no results.

private repos you mean? depends on your team members and number of repos...

if you’re tight for money, you might want to look into bitbucket or other

if they’re open source it’s free

you have to pay only for private repos

say if you do a custom extension for your own client and you don’t want to
share that for a reason or another.

Ah, it's open source I was interested in. Probably I didn't understand when I
first joined

it’s free you can fork other projects/extensions and create new ones for free
so you can chip in if something isn’t quite right

That's good, I've always just cloned things locally as I thought I'd need a
pro account or something. Didn't want to spend on it until I was doing
something that needed it.

usually it works like this: you clone locally if doing no changes

__ __

if you need to do changes you `fork` the project

__ __

push changes to a new branch on your fork.

__ __

then through the github ui you submit a pull-request

You'll know about it first on here if I get a job that needs a private repo :)

I'll be off the shared hosting then as well

Wow. And I used to think that my "500-websites-from-a-single-install" project
was cool... But this has 780 fields overall, so I guess you beat me.
