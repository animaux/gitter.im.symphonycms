@nitriques Thanks!! :-) Actually I want to add a param into the frontend
params list via an event file of a extension written by me. Is that possible ?

@nimanthaharshana just add this for example to the load function of your event

____

Symphony::Engine()- >Page()->_param['this-daynumber']=date("D");
Symphony::Engine()->Page()->_param['this-week']=intval(date("W"));

@nimanthaharshana @wdebusschere I always hate that public property. But sadly,
it is the way to go right now. This might change soon

@nimanthaharshana should be releasing a Stripe payments extension soon. It
looks pretty flexible from what I have seen :-)
