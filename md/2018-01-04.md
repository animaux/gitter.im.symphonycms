Hi All,  
Recently i have upgraded Symphony 2.6.2 to Symphony 2.7.0.  
I'm using Order Entries 2.3.8 extension with one of the section.  
After update i got this error when i trying to reach the section.

"Symphony Fatal Database Error: Expression #1 of ORDER BY clause is not in
SELECT list, references column 'annie.s.sortorder' which is not in SELECT
list; this is incompatible with DISTINCT"

Any one has experience on this?

@SagaraZD do you run MySQL 5.7?

ok thanks @stuartgpalmer . @SagaraZD is the error only when you run the update
? Or when you visit the page in the backend ?

@nitriques. There was no error during update. The error is in the back end
when viewing entries. I tried deleting the relevant lines of code from the
config which define the ordering for that section and it made no difference.
