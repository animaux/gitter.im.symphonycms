Could it be that association field outputs gramatically wrong handles? An
entry called "Steine & Scherben" becomes "steine-und-amp-scherben" (the
associated field is a multilingual text field). The &-sign is correctly turned
into the word "and" but the word "amp" should not be there. This is when I
output the association only. When I output "Associated content" it has the
right handle "steine-und-scherben".
