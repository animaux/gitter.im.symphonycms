It scares me a bit, that this can happen. Especially since the result is all
borked.

    We used to get this errors all the time with imported html or with a bad html editor...

Yes, had to do some really rough html-sanitizing on another site that imported
some really stinky code. But this here was an entry created by a symphony
frontend form.

This never happened to me, even in my "big system" that uses frontend editing
with events and has more than 200.000 entries (estimated 100.000 entries
actually have Markdown content).

Using the default Textarea field, it should not be possible to save invalid
XML.

Normal Textarea, yes.

`it should not be possible` â€”> thatâ€™s what I thought!

Any other extensions involved? Which Markdown extension/variant?

I think it was the Markdown Typography variant, which might be a bit fat at
the bottom end. Maybe itâ€™s a good idea to switch to leaner markdown here, to
be on the safe side.

If you don't want the Purifier stuff, just plain Markdown, you may like this:

However, I must say that my  "big system" always used the standard Markdown
extension (with the "Markdown" setting), and there were no issues either.

I kind of like the typography variant, especially since it accepts forces
line-breaks. The double-space is always hard to communicate to clients â€¦

____

Iâ€™ve switched to standard for that field, which should be perfectly fine in
that case! Thanks for chiming in!

Single line breaks are the pest. Anyway, I hope that it works fine now. Still
I have no idea how this could happen to you. Maybe a bug in the typography
thingie?

Agreed!

No idea â€¦

Never had a problem like that and I use that a lot.

the standard error messages?

____

We have some sites where we bothered to replace that with a custom 500s; its
fairly straight forward.

you create a `template` directory in Workspace. And for each error message you
can make a custom templateâ€¦

the easiest maybe that Iâ€™d send you what I have that covers all scenarios Iâ€™m
