@reygoch VPS but we’ve got a Varnish Server in-front not sure it’s properly
configured but it should mitigate the effects of having an instant surge in
traffic on one article/page.

____

also the DB is on a separate box. (and we use a separate box for backend/cron
processing)

Hi, is there a way to translate symphony event responses in front end? My
symphony install have 2 languages, and I wonder if events can send to front
the language of the visitor. Any idea how I can do that?

yes you should be able to install the language extensions (or create if
necessary) as far as I know they should translate (most) event responses too
if you set it properly

lang extensions allow to set a language for back end users

____

but front will receive default language

yes but they also contain the translation for events (at least that’s how it
was up till a few years back when I used the same messages)

____

ah front will recieve the language you set - depending if you use front-end
languages

____

last I used them fl-languages etc used to link up with the event translations
from the backend - if it’s not that way then there must be a bug/oversight

Guys, if anyone has a minute:

____

I have a set of events that can have multiple dates via a `date_time`field.

____

This way I can have a single event that happens more than once.

____

If I group my XML-output by date, this works ver nice. So an event that’s in
November and December is shown in both.

____

Problem is, each `entry` has all the dates inside, so I have to find out which
is the current one. Which is a bit roundabout in XSLT.

____

Wouldn’t it be the more logical way to handle this in the DS output already?

____

something like a `current`attribute?

____

Would this mean i’d need to modify something in the `date_time` extension, or
rather in a Custom-DS?

Also I’m not sure if an event that’s happening more than once in a month is
output more than once in the month-node. Will have to check that.

____

Ok :)

____

I’ll have a look …

____

Ok, there’s an entry for each date. Good. :checkered_flag:

Found it.

____

But the grouping-logic is a bit above my head for now.

____

Not sure where to get the current date from.

____

Probably a simple counter will be easier to realise than to compare against
the date.

_Thinking of using XSLT instead again …_

To get the number of the date I have to pick for the current entry I can use
`count(preceding::entry[@id=current()/@id]) + 1`

@animaux you want grouping on dates ?

____

if they contain time, it 's going to be pretty hard... if you do not need
pagination, the simpliest thing is to do it in xsl

guys, have there been any changes to the way AppendFormattedElement functions
in a field between 2.6.2 and 2.6.7 at all? I'm trying to use the
numberincrementfield on a 2.6.2 install and it's not playing ball. 2.6.7 is
seemingly working fine though.. odd.

@nitriques yep, grouping basically works fine but the entries include all
dates set in the `date_time`-field rather than only the current one.
@jonmifsud had the idea to mark the current date in the current entry width an
attribute like `current` so it’s easy to pick up via xpath.

____

Managed to make it work with some XSLT anyway, but …
