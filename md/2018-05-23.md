@nitriques due to the current _General Data Protection Regulation_ panic here
in Germany I need to postpone any work on GitHub issues/PRs for some days. I
know that some of the PRs that await my review mean serious changes to the
codebase and/or behaviour, so I will try my best to take a look ASAP (which
might mean next week).
