Today I updated a lot of extensions, marking them as compatible with Symphony
2.6.x. We also moved ownership of the Email Template Manager (ETM) and Email
Newsletter Manager (ENM). I will try and care for them in the future.

release...

@DavidOliver @michael-e @twiro I've updated all extensions that were flagged
as compatible. Did I miss any ?

I did a quick check on symphonyextensions.com for extensions from my "personal
list". The following are working fine for me on Symphony 2.6, but are not
marked as compatible:

__ __

  * Content Type Mappings
  * Entity Diagram
  * Global Resource Loader
  * Publish Shortcuts
  * Section Schemas
  * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Filter

They are running in my big project, so I should notice most issues. I will
update to these extensions to the latest code tomorrow.
