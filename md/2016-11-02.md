@bzerangue that’s probably a question for @allen if he remembers.

Really? To me it seems to a pretty new feature. We had a search box for a long
time, but it was not powered by Algolia.

Ok, then it’s @nitriques who should know :·)

____

Can I not use PHP variables in `addScriptToHead()`?

____

Like
`Administration::instance()->Page->addScriptToHead('http://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?key='
. $api_key, 79);`

____

Does not work

____

Sorry if this is a dumb question … I’m not very firm with PHP …

____

Ok, I think I need to pass the var to the function first. *ducks*

Managed to find out how to do this by looking at other code :·)

You problem probably is `. $api_key, 79` — shouldn't that be `. $api_key . ',
79'`?

Don’t think so.

____

However. I solved it using `private $_api_key = '…';` in `Class
fieldMapLocation extends Field{` and calling via `$this->_api_key`.

____

Fiddling in the Map Location field …

If anyone needs the **Map Location Field**. I’ve hacked together a version
where it’s possible to add an API Key in order to make geocoding possible
again. Plus the ability to add OSM and more custom map layers. API key and
Layers have to be defined in the code though. No UI for that:

There is still a problem with the default location geocoding …

Suddenly https:// is required … therefore the hardcoded http:// geocoding
request fails …

____

Oh dear. I feel like an eremit talking to myself here.

n’ah that was the ADDRESS location field :·)

____

I’m not alone!

____

Ok, fixed in the repo. I’d love to make this field Google-Independent. Not
sure if I’ll find the time thought.

Looks like geocoding currently still works as long as you don’t do too many
request and don’t resave the section …
