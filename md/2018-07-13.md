Map Location Field... We would like to use it for a new project and have done
some initial work trying to set it up.

There was a PHP 7.1 issue which @nimanthaharshana
[fixed](https://github.com/nimanthaharshana/maplocationfield) but the
filtering by distance doesn't appear to be working for us (we are using
"within 500 miles of London").

I just wanted to check up if others are using the field with PHP 7.x and if
there is anything I should know about!? Thanks
