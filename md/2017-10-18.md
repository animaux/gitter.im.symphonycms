Unfortuately I have no permissions to manage the settings, so I can not
activate the "issues" for this repo. @nitriques must do it.

Ha, I am vieux enough to retire. But Excel tells me that it will take another
130 years to make enough money.

Hi All. I am trying to install a couple of extensions (importcsv and publish
shortcuts) on Sym 2.7.0 running on Ubuntu 16 / PHP7. When I try to install
either I get this error:

`Declaration of extension_publish_shortcuts::update($previousVersion) should
be compatible with Extension::update($previousVersion = false)`

Can anyone suggest a fix for this please

@stuartgpalmer AFAIK this tells that the extension needs
`update($previousVersion = false)`, just like the function in the parent
class. PHP 7 is very picky regarding function signatures.

@nitriques I would really like to clean up the Members issues. I will comment
on some issues which can be closed, IMHO.

@stuartgpalmer did you get members and importcsv working mate? We've done it a
few times here without any issues. Complex field types which importcsv doesn't
support sometimes make it fail, but other than that it was all gravy!
